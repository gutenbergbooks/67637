<h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV. <br /> MARRIAGE CEREMONIES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When marriage was determined on, whether love
or interest prompted to it, the business part of the
transaction, which in all countries is exceedingly
unromantic, was delegated, as in China, to a female
matchmaker,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> whose professional duties appear to
have been considered important. She carried the
lovers proposals to the family of his mistress, or
rather, perhaps, broke the ice and paved the way
for him. In the earlier ages men, no doubt, performed
this delicate office themselves, or entrusted
it to their parents; as in Homer we find Achilles
declaring, that his father Peleus shall choose a wife
for him. Earlier still, if we may credit certain prevalent
traditions, men dispensed altogether with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>preliminaries and lived <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“more pecudum”</span> with the
first females who came in their way; a state of barbarism
from which it is said they were reclaimed
by Cecrops.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> But, to whomsoever this fable may
trace its origin, it is evidently unworthy of the
slightest credit. Of times sunk in such an abyss
of ignorance no record could remain, or even of
many succeeding revolutions of manners touching
close upon the orbit of civilisation. If, however,
the tradition arose originally out of any real innovation
in manners, it may refer to the partial abolition
of polygamy, which, whether made by Cecrops
or not, was an important step in the progress of
the Greeks towards polished life.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if Cecrops ever lived, and should not be regarded
as a mere mythological creation, we must
still reject the comparatively modern tradition which
fetches him from Egypt. Coming from the East,
he would more probably have instituted polygamy
than the contrary. In every point of view the tradition
is absurd; for it at once represents the people
of Attica as savages, and as having made considerable
advances in the science of civil government.
They have already emerged from the state of patriarchal
rule, not by any means the lowest, and
have arrived at the monarchical period in the history
of society—for Cecrops marries the daughter of king
Actæos—yet have not made the first step in refinement,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>have not passed the barrier dividing the rudest
savage from even the barbarian,—had not made the
discovery that, for the preservation of society, children
must be cared for and maintained, which is
impossible until they have other fathers than the
community. We must, therefore, reject this Cecropian
legend, and acknowledge that, from the earliest
times of which any record remains, the people of
Hellas married and were given in marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever the original practice of the Greeks may
have been, traces of polygamy long continued discernible
in their manners. Heracles maintained a
seraglio worthy of an Ottoman sultan. His wives, indeed,
like those of a wandering Brahmin, were scattered
at convenient points over the country, that, whithersoever
he roamed, he might find lodging and entertainment;
but, as rumours of his different establishments
travelled about, the jealousy of the ladies was
at last excited and proved fatal to him. Ægeus, too,
and his brother Pallas, old Priam, Agamemnon, Theseus,
and nearly every public man in the heroic
times, are represented as possessing a harem. Indeed,
to judge by the practice of princes, it would seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>as if polygamy were the law of every land; so habitual
is it with them to transgress, in this point,
against public opinion. A report, still current among
certain writers, represents Socrates with two wives,
the gentle nature of Xantippe encouraging him, perhaps,
to venture on a second! But even that diligent
retailer of scandal, Athenæus,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> rejects this story,
which, no doubt, originated with some sophist, who
owed the philosopher a grudge. If not in the son
of Sophroniscos, however, at least in Philip of Macedon,
the kings of heroic times found an exact imitator.
This Pellæan fox, though he did not, like
the Persian monarch, lead about with him an army
of concubines in his military expeditions, yet, from
policy or other motives, contracted numerous marriages,
as many, perhaps, as Heracles. Satyros has
bequeathed to us a curious account of his majesty’s
matrimonial exploits. During his long reign, of
from twenty to four-and-twenty years, the dishes of
one nuptial feast had scarcely time to cool before
a new one was in preparation. It was nothing but
truffles and rich soup from June till June. I am
unable to furnish a list of all the ladies who claimed,
through Philip’s diffusive love, to be queens of Macedon;
but it may be proper to name a few, to
show how the morals of his subjects must have been
improved by his example. The first lady whose
landed attractions won Philip’s heart was <em>Andatè</em>,
an Illyrian, by whom he had a daughter, called
Cynna. To her succeeded <em>Phila</em>, sister of Derda and
Macatè. His next wives were two Thessalian women,
<em>Pherè</em> of Nikesipolis, mother of Thessalonia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and <em>Philinna</em> of Larissa, mother of Aridæos. Had
he sought merely the women these might have sufficed;
but Philip had other views, and, finding marriage
a still more expeditious method of extending
his dominions even than conquest, he forthwith added
to the list <em>Olympias</em>, who brought him the
kingdom of Molossia in dowry, and, as every one
knows, was mother of Alexander. Had the crafty
prince stopped here, posterity, overlooking his immorality,
might have applauded his prudence. But,
elated by success, he proceeded to augment the
number of his queens. To Olympias succeeded
<em>Meda</em>, daughter of Cithalas, king of Thrace; and,
lastly, <em>Cleopatra</em>, sister of Hippostratos, and niece
of Attalos. By this time he was somewhat advanced
in years, for Alexander, son of Olympias,
approached manhood. At the feast given in honour
of this new marriage, when the wine had
circulated, as was customary among Macedonians,
Attalos, who had probably drunk deep, observed,
“At length we shall have legitimate princes, not
bastards!” Alexander, who was present, in resentment
of the affront, threw his goblet in the face
of Attalos, who saluted him in the same way. Upon
this, perceiving how matters were likely to proceed,
Olympias fled to Molossia, Alexander into Illyria.
Philip lived to have by Cleopatra one daughter,
Europa; but, shortly afterwards, at the instigation,
it is supposed of Olympias and Alexander, was
murdered by Pausanias.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Ordinary individuals, however, were restrained
from the commission of such immoralities by the
laws, more particularly at Athens, where marriage
was contemplated with all the reverence due to
the great palladium of civilisation. As a necessary
consequence, celibacy could be no other than disreputable,
so that, to a man ambitious of public
honour, the possession of a wife and children was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>no less indispensable than the means of living.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
Among the Spartans, bachelors were delivered over
to the tender mercies of the women, and subjected
to very heavy penalties. During the celebration of
certain festivals they were seized by a crowd of petulant
viragoes, each able to strangle an ox,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and
dragged in derision round the altars of the gods,
receiving from the fists of their gentle tormentors
such blows as the regular practice of boxing had
taught the young ladies to inflict.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

      <div class='line'>“And ladies sometimes hit exceeding hard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But we shall be the less inclined to judge uncharitably
of this somewhat unfeminine custom, if
we consider that, in the ancient world, no less than
in the modern, unmarried and childless women were
held but in slight esteem. And this feeling, which
never for a moment slumbers in society, teaches
better than the cant of a thousand sentimentalists
what the true origin of love is.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the impediments to marriage arising, among
ancient nations, from relationship or consanguinity,
very little is with certainty known. In the heroic
ages, all unions excepting those of parents with
their children appear to have been lawful; for, in
the Odyssey, we find the six sons of Æolos joined
in marriage with their six sisters, the manners of
the olden times, abandoned on earth, still lingering
among the gods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Iphidamos has to wife his mother’s sister,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and
Alcinoös, by no means a profligate or immoral prince,
is united with his brother’s daughter;<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Deiphobos,
after Paris’s death, takes possession of Helen,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and
Helenos, the seer, is united in wedlock with Andromache,
the widow of his brother Hector.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> But
without alleging any further examples, we may, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the practice imputed to the gods, among whom
scarcely any degree of relationship was a bar to
marriage, infer that, in very early ages, few scruples
were entertained upon the subject. Later mythologists
have even imputed to Zeus an illicit amour
with his daughter Aphrodite,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> but libellously, and
in contradiction to the best ancient authorities.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
Nature, indeed, has so peremptorily prohibited the
union of parents with their own children, that positive
laws forbidding connexions so nefarious, have
in all ages been nearly unnecessary, though the superstition
of the Magi<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> in ancient, and the profligacy
of popes and princes in modern times, have
been accused of transgressing these natural boundaries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could we credit the sophist of Naucratis, there
was likewise one distinguished person<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> among the
Athenians who coveted the reputation of equal guilt.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The marriage of brothers with their own sisters
was, in later ages, considered illegal; not so with respect
to half sisters by the fathers’s side, whom no
law forbade men to marry.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Still the recorded examples
of those who availed themselves of this privilege
are few; but among them we find the great
Cimon, son of Miltiades, who, from affection, observes
Cornelius Nepos, and in perfect conformity with the
manners of his country, took to wife his sister Elpinice.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
Plutarch, too, speaks of the union as public
and legal, but Athenæus<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> characteristically insinuates
that Elpinice was merely her brother’s mistress.
The Spartan law took a different view of
what constitutes sisterhood. Here the father was
everything, and therefore with an uterine sister, as
no near relation, marriage might be contracted.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> All
connexions in the direct line of ascent or descent
were prohibited; but the prohibition extended not
to the collateral branches,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> uncles being permitted
to take to wife their nieces, and nephews their
aunts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The precise age at which an Athenian citizen
might legally take upon him the burden of a
family, is said, without proof, though not altogether
without probability, to have been determined by
Solon; for such matters were in those ages supposed
to come within the legitimate scope of legislation.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
They attributed to the season of youth a much greater
duration than comports with our notions. It was, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>fact, thought to extend to the age of thirty-five or
thirty-seven, more or less: when entering upon the
less flowery domain of manhood, men would need
the aid and consolation of a helpmate. But if there
ever existed such a law it was often broken,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> for
early marriages, though less common perhaps than
in modern times, are constantly alluded to both by
historians and poets. Apprehensions of the too great
increase of population already led philosophers, even
in those early ages, vainly to apply themselves to
the discovery of checks, which the irresistible impulses
of nature always render nugatory; and viewing
in that light the regulation attributed to Solon,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
they, with some variation, adopt it in their political
works. Plato,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> in accordance with Hesiod’s notion,
fixes for the male, the marriageable age at
thirty; but Aristotle, who chose on most points to
differ from his master, allows his citizens seven years
more of liberty. For women the proper age, he
thought, is about eighteen. His reasons are, that
the husband and wife will thus flourish and decay
together; and, their offspring inheriting the bloom
and highest vigour of their parents, be at once<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
healthy in body and energetic in mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Winter, more particularly the month of January,
thence called Gamelion, or the “Nuptial Month,”
was regarded as the fittest season<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> of the year for
the celebration of marriage; and if the north wind
happened to blow, as at that time of the year it
often does, the circumstance was supposed to be
peculiarly auspicious. For this notion several physiological
reasons are assigned; as that, during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>prevalence of that wind, the human frame is peculiarly
nervous and full of energy; that the spirits
are consequently light, and the temper and disposition
sweet, cheerful, and flexible. Lingering sparks
of ancient superstition may also have had their share
in establishing this persuasion: towards that quarter
of the heavens, as towards an universal <em>Kebleh</em>, all
the civilised nations of antiquity turned as the
home of their gods; in that direction point all the
openings of the Egyptian pyramids; thither to the
present moment turn the Chinese and Brahmins
when they pray, and in the holy tabernacle of the
Jews the Table of Shewbread<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> likewise faced the
north. Attention, too, was paid to the lunar influences;
for, no other circumstance preventing it,
it was usual to fix on the full of the moon, when
the festival denominated <em>Theogamia</em>, or “Nuptials
of the Gods” was celebrated, in order that religion
itself, by its august and venerable ceremonies,
might appear to sanctify the union of mortals
effected under its auspices.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this practice there are several allusions in ancient
writers. Agamemnon, in Euripides, when questioned
by his wife respecting the time of Iphigenia’s
marriage, replies, that it shall take place</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the blest moon its silvery circle fills.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>And Themis, adjudging Thetis to Peleus, to terminate
the contentions of the gods, selects the same
season for the solemnization of the nuptial rites.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But when next that solemn eve</div>
      <div class='line'>Duly doth the moon divide,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the chieftain let her leave</div>
      <div class='line'>Her lovely virgin zone aside.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Most ancient nations, as the Hebrews, Indians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Thracians, Germans, and Gauls, regarded women as
a marketable commodity; and, in this respect, the
Greeks of early times perfectly agreed with them,
buying and selling their females like cattle.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> But,
by degrees, as manners grew more polished, this
barbarous custom was discontinued, though, in remembrance
of it, presents were still made both to
the father and the bride, even in the most civilised
periods. We must, nevertheless, beware that we
infer not too much from these gifts; for equally
primitive and prevalent was the custom imposing
upon fathers the necessity of dowrying their daughters.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
In the case, too, of the husband’s death this
matrimonial portion devolved to the children, so that
if the widow chose,—as widows sometimes will,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>—to
embark a second time on the connubial sea, her
father was called upon to furnish a fresh outfit.
But, if the husband grew tired of his better half,
and would insist on a divorce, or if, after his death,
the sons were sufficiently unnatural to chase their
mother from the paternal roof, the right over the
entire dowry reverted to her.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Parties were usually betrothed before marriage
by their parents. And young women, whose parents
no longer survived, were settled in marriage by
their brothers, grandfathers, or guardians. Husbands
on their deathbeds sometimes disposed of the hands
of their wives, as in the case of Demosthenes’ father,
who bequeathed Cleobula to Aphobos, whom
he likewise appointed guardian of his children. In
this instance, the widow had better have chosen for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>herself. Aphobos possessed himself of the dowry,
and consented to fulfil the office of guardian, that
he might plunder the children; but the marriage he
declined. Another example occurs in the case of
Phormio who, having been slave<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> to an opulent
citizen, and conducted himself with zeal and fidelity,
received at once his freedom and the widow
of his master. In all serious matters the Athenians
were a very methodical people, and conducted
everything, even to the betrothing or marrying
of a wife, with an attention to form worthy the
quaintest citizen of our own great city.</p>

<p class='c001'>Potter observes, with great naïveté, that, before
men married, it was customary to provide themselves
with a house to live in. The custom was a
good one, and the thrifty old poet of Ascra, undertaking
to enlighten his countrymen in economics,
is explicit on the point—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“First build your house and let the wife succeed:”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>which, no doubt, is better advice than if he had
said “first marry a wife and next consider where
you shall put her.” And we find that, even among
pastoral, young ladies who, in modern poets, make
their meat and drink of love, and hang up a rag or
two of it to preserve them from the elements, in
antiquity posed their lovers with interrogations about
comforts. “You are very pressing, my dear Daphnis,
and swear you love me; but that is not just now
the question. Have you a house and harem to take
me to?”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But prudent as they may be considered, the Athenians
were still more pious than thrifty. Before
the virgin quitted her childhood’s home, and passed
from the state she had tried, and in most cases, perhaps,
found happy, to enter into one altogether unknown
to her, custom demanded the performance, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the day before the marriage, of several religious ceremonies
eminently significant and beautiful. Hitherto,
in the poetical recesses of their thalamoi, they had
been reckoned as so many nymphs attached to the
train of the virgin goddess of the woods. About
to become members of a noviciate more conformable
to nature than that of the Catholic church,
they deemed it incumbent on them to implore their
Divinity’s permission to transfer their worship from
her to Hymen; and, the more readily to obtain it,
they approached her, in the simplicity of their hearts,
with baskets full of offerings such as it became them
to present and her to receive.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Nor was Artemis
the only deity sought, on this occasion, to be rendered
auspicious by sacrifice and prayer. Offerings
were likewise made to the Nymphs, those lovely
creations with which the fancy of the Greeks peopled
the streams and fountains of their native land.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
These rites performed, the future bride was conducted
in pomp to the citadel, where solemn sacrifice
was offered up to Athena, the tutelar goddess
of the state, with prayers for happiness, peculiarly the
gift of supreme wisdom.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> To Hera, also, and the
Fates,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> as to the goddesses that watched over the
connubial state and rigidly punished those who transgressed
its sacred laws, were gifts presented, and
vows preferred; and on one or all of their several
altars did the maiden deposit a lock of her own
hair, in remoter ages, perhaps, the whole of it, to
intimate that, having obtained a husband, she must
preserve him by other means than beauty, and the
arts of the toilette.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> At Megara the young women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>devoted their severed locks to Iphinoë. Those of
Delos to Hecaerga and Ops,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a> while, like the Athenians,
the maidens of Argos performed this rite in
honour of Athena.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Having, by the performance of the above rites and
others of similar significance, discharged their instant
duties to the gods, and impressed on their own minds
a deep sense of the sacred engagements they were
about to contract, they proceeded to perform the
nuptial ceremonies themselves, still intermingling the
offices of religion with every portion of the transaction.
An auspicious day having been fixed upon,
the relations and friends of both parties assembled
in magnificent apparel, at the house of the bride’s
father, where all the ladies of the family were busily
engaged in the recitation of prayers and presentation
of offerings. These domestic ceremonies concluded,
the bride, accompanied by her paranymph or
bridesmaid, was led forth into the street by the
bridegroom and one of his most intimate friends,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a>
who placed her between them in an open carriage.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
Their dresses, as was fitting, were of the richest and
most splendid kind. Those of the bridegroom full,
flowing, and of the gayest and brightest colours,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
glittered with golden ornaments, and diffused around,
as he moved, a cloud of perfume. The bride herself,
gifted with that unerring taste which distinguished
her nation, appeared in a costume at once simple and
magnificent—simple in its contour, its masses, its
folds, magnificent from the brilliance of its hues
and the superb and costly style of its ornaments.
She was not, like some modern court dame, a blaze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of precious stones tastelessly heaped upon each other;
but through the snowy gauze of her veil flashed the
jewelled fillet and coronet-like sphendone which, with
a chaplet of flowers,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> adorned her dark tresses; and
between the folds of her robe of gold-embroidered
purple, appeared her gloveless fingers, with many
rings glittering with gems. Strings of Red Sea
pearls encircled her neck and arms; pendants, variously
wrought and dropped with Indian jewels,
twinkled in her ears; and her feet, partly concealed
by the falling robe, displayed a portion of the golden
thonged sandal, crusted with emeralds, rubies, or
pearls. But all these ornaments often failed to distract
the eye from those which she owed to nature.
Her luxuriant hair, which in Eastern women often
reaches the ground:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her hair in hyacinthine flow,</div>
      <div class='line'>When left to roll its folds below,</div>
      <div class='line'>As ’midst her maidens in the ball</div>
      <div class='line'>She stood superior to them all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath swept the marble, where her feet</div>
      <div class='line'>Gleamed whiter than the mountain sleet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere from the cloud that gave it birth</div>
      <div class='line'>It fell and caught one stain of earth;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>her hair, I say, perfumed with delicate unguents,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
such as nard from Tarsos, œranthe from Cypros,
essence of roses from Cyrene, of lilies from Ægina
or Cilicia, fell loosely in a profusion of ringlets
over her shoulders, while in front it was confined by
the fillet and grasshoppers of gold.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> More perishable
ornaments, in the shape of crowns of myrtle,
wild thyme,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> poppy, white sesame, with other flowers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and plants sacred to Aphrodite, adorned the heads
of both bride and bridegroom.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The relations and friends followed, forming, in most
cases, a long and stately procession, which, in the
midst of crowds of spectators, moved slowly towards
the temple, thousands strewing flowers or scattering
perfume in their path, and in loud exclamations
comparing the happy pair to the most impassioned
and beautiful of their nymphs and gods.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Meanwhile,
a number of the bride’s friends, scattered
among the multitude, were looking out anxiously
for favourable omens, and desirous, in conjunction
with every person present, to avert all such as superstition
taught them to consider inauspicious. A
crow appearing singly was supposed to betoken sorrow
or separation, whereas, a couple of crows,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> issuing
from the proper quarter of the heavens,
presaged perfect union and happiness. A pair of
turtle doves, of all omens, was esteemed the best.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On reaching the temple, the bride and bridegroom
were received at the door by a priest, who presented
them with a small branch of ivy, as an emblem of
the close ties by which they were about to be united
for ever. They were then conducted to the
altar,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a> where the ceremonies commenced with the
sacrifice of a heifer,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a> after which Artemis, Athena,
and other virgin goddesses, were solemnly invoked.
Prayers were then addressed to Zeus and his consort,
the supreme divinities of Olympos;<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> nor, on this
occasion, would they overlook the ancient gods, Ouranos
and Gaia, whose union produces fertility and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>abundance,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a>—the Graces, whose smile shed upon life
its sweetest charm, and the Fates, who shorten or
extend it at their pleasure, were next in order
adored; and, lastly, Aphrodite, the mother of Love,
and of all the host of Heaven, the most beautiful
and beneficent to mortals.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> The victim having been
opened, the gall was taken out and significantly
cast behind the altar.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Soothsayers skilled in divination
then inspected the entrails, and if their appearance
was alarming the nuptials were broken
off, or deferred. When favourable, the rites proceeded
as if hallowed by the smile of the gods.
The bride now cut off one of her tresses, which,
twisting round a spindle, she placed as an offering
on the altar of Athena, while, in imitation of Theseus,
the bridegroom made a similar oblation to
Apollo, bound, as an emblem of his out-door life,
round a handful of grass or herbs.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> All the other
gods, protectors of marriage, were then, by the parents
or friends, invoked in succession, and the rites
thus completed, the virgin’s father, placing the hand
of the bridegroom in that of the bride, said, “I bestow on
thee my daughter, that thine eyes may
be gladdened by legitimate offspring.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a> The oath
of inviolable fidelity was now taken by both, and
the ceremony concluded with fresh sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c001'>The performance of rites so numerous generally
consumed the whole day, so that the shades of evening
were falling before the bride could be conducted
to her future home. This hour, indeed, according
to some, was chosen to conceal the blushes of the
youthful wife.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a> And now commenced the secular
portion of the ceremony. Numerous attendants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>bearing lighted torches,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a> ran in front of the procession,
while bands of merry youths dancing, singing,
or playing on musical instruments, surrounded the
nuptial car. Similar in this respect was the practice
throughout Greece, even so early as the time
of Homer, who thus, in his description of the Shield,
calls up before our imagination the lively picture of
an heroic nuptial procession:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c014'>The song on this occasion sung received the name
of the “Carriage Melody,” from the carriage in which
the married pair rode while it was chaunted.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The house of the bridegroom, diligently prepared
for their reception, was decorated profusely with garlands,
and brilliantly lighted up. When, among the
Bœotians, the lady, accompanied by her husband, had
descended from the carriage, its axletree was burnt,
to intimate that having found a home she would have
no further use for it.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> The celebration of nuptial
rites generally puts people in good temper, at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>for the first day; and new-married women at Athens
stood in full need of all they could muster to assist
them through the crowd of ceremonies which beset
the entrances to the houses of their husbands. Symbols
of domestic labours, pestles, sieves,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and so on,
met the young wife’s eye on all sides. She herself,
in all her pomp of dress, bore in her hands an earthen
barley-parcher.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a> But, to comfort her, very nice cakes
of sesamum,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a> with wine and fruit and other dainties
innumerable, accompanied by gleeful and welcoming
faces, appeared in the background beyond the sieves
and pestles. The hymeneal lay,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a> with sundry other
songs, all redolent of “joy and youth,” resounded
through halls now her own. Mirth and delight
ushered her into the banqueting-room, where appeared
a boy covered with thorn branches, and oaken boughs
laden with acorns, who, when the epithalamium
chaunters had ceased, recited an ancient hymn beginning
with the words, “I have escaped the worse and
found the better.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> This hymn, constituting a portion
of the divine service performed by the Athenians
during a festival instituted in commemoration of the
discovery of corn, by which men were delivered from
acorn-eating, they introduced among the nuptial ceremonies
to intimate, that wedlock is as much superior
to celibacy as wheat is to mast. At the close of the
recitation, there entered a troop of dancing girls
crowned with myrtle-wreaths, and habited in light
tunics reaching very little below the knee, just as
we still behold them on antique gems and vases, who,
by their varied, free, and somewhat wanton, movements,
vividly represented all the warmth and energy
of passion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The feast which now ensued was, at Athens, to
prevent useless extravagance, made liable to the inspection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of certain magistrates. Both sexes partook
of it; but, in conformity with the general spirit of their
manners and institutions, the ladies, as in Egypt, sat
at separate tables.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a> At these entertainments we may
infer that, among other good things, great quantities
of sweetmeats were consumed, since the woman employed
in kneading and preparing them, and in officiating
at the nuptial sacrifices, was deemed of sufficient
importance to possess a distinct appellation,
(δημιουργὸς,)<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> while the bride-cake, which doubtless
was the crowning achievement of her art, received the
name of Gamelios. The general arrangement of the
banquet, however, they entrusted to the care of a sort
of major-domo, who received the appellation of Trapezopoios.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the princes and grandees of Macedonia the
nuptial banquet differed very widely, as might be expected,
from the frugal entertainments of the Athenians;
but as it may assist us in comprehending the
changes introduced into Hellenic manners by the
conquests of Alexander and his successors, I shall
crave the reader’s permission to lay before him a description,
bequeathed to us by antiquity, of the magnificent
banquet<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a> given at the marriage of Caranos.</p>

<p class='c001'>The guests, twenty in number, immediately on
entering the mansion of the bridegroom, were crowned
by his order with golden stlengides,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a> each valued at
five pieces of gold. They were then introduced into
the banqueting-hall, where the first article set before
them on taking their places at the board was, no
doubt, exceedingly agreeable, consisting of a silver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>beaker presented to each as a gift, which, when they
had drained off, they delivered to their attendant
slaves, who, according to the custom of the country,
stood behind their seats with large baskets intended
to contain the presents to be bestowed on them by
the master of the feast.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> There was then placed before
every member of the company a bronze salver,
of Corinthian workmanship, completely covered by a
cake, on which were piled roast fowls and ducks and
woodcocks, and a goose, together with other dainties
in great abundance. These, likewise, followed the
beakers into the corbels of the slaves, and were succeeded
by numerous dishes, of which the guests were
expected to partake on the spot. Next was brought
in a capacious silver tray, also covered by a cake,
whereon were heaped up geese, hares, kids, other
cakes curiously wrought, pigeons, turtle-doves, partridges,
with a variety of similar game, which, likewise,
after they had been tasted, I presume, were
handed to the servants.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When the rage of hunger had been appeased, as
it must soon have been, they washed their hands,
after which crowns, wreathed from every kind of
flower, were brought in, and along with them other
golden stlengides, equal in weight to the former,
were placed, for form’s sake, on the heads of the
company, before they found their way to the baskets
in the rear.</p>

<p class='c001'>While they were still in a sort of delirium of joy,
occasioned by the munificence of the bridegroom,
there entered to them a troop of female flute players,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>singers, and Rhodian performers on the Sambukè,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
naked in the opinion of some, though others reported
them to have worn a slight tunic. When these
performers had given them a sufficient taste of their
art, they retired to make way for other female slaves,
bearing each a pair of perfume vases, containing
the measure of a cotyla, the one of gold, the other
of silver, and bound together by a golden thong.
Of these every guest received a pair. In fact, the
princely bridegroom, in order, as we suppose, that his
friends might share with him the joy of his nuptials,
bestowed upon every one of them a fortune
instead of a supper; for immediately upon the heels
of the gift above described came a number of silver
dishes, each of sufficient dimensions to contain
a large roast pig, laid upon its back, with its paunch
thrown open, and stuffed with all sorts of delicacies
which had been roasted with it, such as thrushes,
metræ, and becaficoes, with the yolk of eggs poured
around them, and oysters and cockles. Of these
dishes every person present received one, with its
contents, and, immediately afterwards, such another
dish containing a kid hissing hot. Upon this, Caranos
observing that their corbils were crammed,
caused to be presented to them wicker panniers,
and elegant bread-baskets, plaited with slips of ivory.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
Delighted by his generosity, the company loudly
applauded the bridegroom, testifying their approbation
by clapping their hands. Then followed other
gifts, and perfume vases of gold and silver, presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to the company in pairs as before. The bustle
having subsided, there suddenly rushed in a troop
of performers worthy to have figured in the feast
of the Chytræ,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a> at Athens, and along with them ithyphalli,
jugglers, and naked female wonder-workers,
who danced upon their heads in circles of swords, and
spouted fire from their mouths. These performances
ended, they set themselves more earnestly and hotly
to drink, from capacious golden goblets, their wines,
now less mixed than before, being the Thasian, the
Mendian, and the Lesbian. A glass dish, three feet
in diameter, was next brought in upon a silver stand,
on which were piled all kinds of fried fish. This
was accompanied by silver bread-baskets, filled with
Cappadocian rolls, some of which they ate, and delivered
the rest to their slaves. They then washed
their hands, and were crowned with golden crowns,
double the weight of the former, and presented with
a third pair of gold and silver vases filled with
perfume. They by this time had become quite delirious
with wine, and began a truly Macedonian
contest, in which the winner was he who swallowed
most; Proteas, grandson of him who was boon companion
to Alexander the Great, drinking upwards
of a gallon at a draught, and exclaiming—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Most joy is in his soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Who drains the largest bowl.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The immense goblet was then given him by Caranos,
who declared, that every man should reckon
as his own property the bowl whose contents he
could despatch. Upon this, nine valiant bacchanals
started up at once, and sought each to empty the
goblet before the others, while one unhappy wight
among the company, envying them their good fortune,
sat down and burst into tears because he
should go cupless away. The master of the house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>however, unwilling that any should be dissatisfied,
presented him with an empty bowl.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A chorus of a hundred men now entered to chaunt
the epithalamium; and after them dancing girls,
dressed in the character of nymphs and nereids.</p>

<p class='c001'>The drinking still proceeding, and the darkness of
evening coming on, the circle of the hall appeared
suddenly to dilate, a succession of white curtains,
which had extended all round, and disguised its
dimensions, being drawn up, while from numerous
recesses in the wall, thrown open by concealed
machinery, a blaze of torches flashed upon the guests,
seeming to be borne by a troop of gods and goddesses,
Hermes, Pan, Artemis, and the Loves, with numerous
other divinities, each holding a flambeau and administering
light to the assembled mortals.</p>

<p class='c001'>While every person was expressing his admiration
of this contrivance, wild boars of true Erymanthean
dimensions, transfixed with silver javelins, were
brought in on square trays with golden rims, one of
which was presented to each of the company. To
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon vivants</i></span> themselves nothing appeared so worthy
of commendation, as that, when anything wonderful
was exhibited, they should all have been able to get
upon their legs, and preserve the perpendicular, notwithstanding
they were so top-heavy with wine.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our slaves,” says one of the guests, “piled all the
gifts we had received in our baskets; and the trumpet,
according to the custom of the Macedonians,
at length announced the termination of the repast.”
Caranos next began that part of the potations in
which small cups alone figured, and commanded the
slaves to circulate the wine briskly; what they drank
in this second bout being regarded as an antidote
against that which they had swallowed before.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>They were now, as might be supposed, in the right
trim to be amused, and there entered to them the
buffoon Mandrogenes, a descendant, it was said, of
Strato the Athenian. This professional gentleman
for a long time shook their sides with laughter, and
terminated his performances by dancing with his wife,
an old woman, upwards of eighty.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> This fit of merriment
would appear to have restored the edge of their
appetites, and made them ready for those supplementary
dainties which closed the achievements of the
day. These consisted of a variety of sweetmeats,
rendered more tempting by the little ivory-plaited
corbels in which they nestled, delicate cakes from
Crete, and Samos, and Attica, in the boxes in which
they were imported.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hippolochos, to whose enthusiasm for descriptions
of good cheer, the reader is indebted for the above
picturesque details, concludes his important narrative
by observing, that, when they rose to depart, their
anxiety respecting the wealth they had acquired
sobered them completely. He then adds, addressing
himself to his correspondent Lynceus, “Meanwhile
you, my friend, remaining all alone at Athens, enjoy
the lectures of Theophrastus with your thyme,
rocket and delicate twists, mingling in the revels
of the Linnean and Chytrean festivals. For our
own part we are looking out, some for houses, others
for estates, others for slaves, to be purchased by
the riches which dropped into our baskets at the
supper of Caranos.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The marriage feast having been thus concluded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the bride was conducted to the harem by the light
of flambeaux, round one of which, pre-eminently
denominated the “Hymeneal Torch,” her mother,
who was principal among the torch-bearers, twisted
her hair-lace,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a> unbound at the moment from her head.
On retiring to the nuptial chamber the bride, in
obedience to the laws, ate a quince, together with
the bridegroom, to signify, we are told, that their
first conversation should be full of sweetness and
harmony.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a> The guests continued their revels with
music, dancing, and song, until far in the night.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At daybreak on the following morning their friends
re-assembled and saluted them with a new epithalamium,
exhorting them to descend from their bower
to enjoy the beauties of the dawn,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> which in that
warm and genial climate are even in January equal
to those of a May morning with us. On appearing in
the presence of their congratulators, the wife, as a mark
of affection, presented her husband with a rich woollen
cloak,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a> in part, at least, the production of her own
fair hands. On the same occasion the father of the
bride sent a number of costly gifts to the house of
his son-in-law, consisting of cups, goblets, or vases
of alabaster or gold, beds, couches, candelabra, or
boxes for perfumes or cosmetics, combs, jewel-cases,
costly sandals, or other articles of use or luxury.
And, that so striking an instance of his wealth and
generosity might not escape public observation, the
whole was conveyed to the bridegroom’s house in
great pomp by female slaves, before whom marched
a boy clothed in white, and bearing a torch in
his hand, accompanied by a youthful basket-bearer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>habited like a canephora in the sacred processions.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
Customs in spirit exactly similar still survive among
the primitive mountaineers of Wales, where the newly-married
couple, in the middle and lower ranks of
life, have their houses completely furnished by the
free-will offerings, not only of their parents but of
their friends. It is, however, incumbent on the recipients
to make proof in their turn of equal generosity
when any member of the donor’s family ventures
on the hazards of housekeeping.</p>

defers too much to “the traditions
received in the polished
ages” when, upon the authority
of such traditions and of
such writers as Justin (ii. 6.), he
appears to conclude that, before
the time of Cecrops, the people
of Attica were in knowledge and
civilisation inferior to the wildest
savages. Hist, of Greece, i. 58.
Upon legends and authors of this
description no reliance can be
placed. If society existed, everything
“indispensable” to society
also existed; therefore, if marriage
be so, it could not be unknown.
Besides, how happens it that this
same Cecrops who instituted marriage
did not likewise teach them
to sow corn, which, if Egypt was,
when he left it, a civilised country,
must have been as familiar to him
as matrimony? This most necessary
acquisition, however, they
were left to make many ages
afterwards, during the reign of
Erechtheus. Justin, ii. 6.</p>

14. 1.—The reason why he was
thus said to partake of two natures—half-man
and half-snake—has
been very variously and very
fantastically explained. Diodorus
Siculus, (i. p. 17,) derives his
title to be considered half a
man and half a beast, from his
being, by choice a Greek, by nature
a barbarian. Yet he conceives
that it was the beast that
civilised the man. Others explain
διφυὴς somewhat differently
to mean that he was of gigantic
stature and understood two
languages: διὰ μῆκος σώματος οὑτω
καλούμενος, ὅς φήσιν ὁ Φιλόχορος,
ἢ ὅτι Αἰγυπτίων τὰς δύο
γλώσσας ἠπίστατο.—Euseb. No.
460.—Eustathius, familiar with
the fables of the mythology, turns
the tables upon Cecrops, and
conceives that he may have
civilised himself, not the Athenians,
by settling in Attica. He
supposes him ἀπὸ ὄφεως εἰς ἀνθρωπὸν

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER V.<br /> CONDITION OF MARRIED WOMEN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From the spirit pervading the foregoing ceremonies
it will be seen, that married women enjoyed at
Athens numerous external tokens of respect. We
must now enter the harem, and observe how they
lived there. Most, perhaps, of the misapprehensions
which prevail on this subject arise out of one very
obvious omission,—a neglect to distinguish between
the exaggeration and satire of the comic poets, much
of which, in all countries, has been levelled at women,
and the sober truth of history, less startling, and therefore,
less palatable. To comprehend the Athenians,
however, we must be content to view them as they
were, with many virtues and many vices, often sinning
against their women, but never as a general
rule treating them harshly. Indeed, according to
no despicable testimony, their errors when they erred
would appear to have lain in the contrary direction.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly the mistress of a family at Athens was
not placed above the necessity of extending her solicitude
to the government of her household, though
too many even there neglected it, degenerating into
the resemblance of those mawkish, insipid, useless
things, without heart or head, who often in our times
fill fashionable drawing-rooms, and have their reputations
translated to Doctors’ Commons. Of female
education I have already spoken, together with the
several acts and ceremonies, which conducted an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Athenian woman to the highest and most honourable
station her sex can fill on earth. In this new relation
she shares with her husband that domestic patriarchal
sovereignty, pictures of which abound in the Scriptures.
How great soever might be the establishment,
she was queen of every thing within doors. All the
slaves, male and female, came under her control.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
To every one she distributed his task, and issued her
commands; and when there were no children who
required her care, she might often be seen sitting
in the recesses of the harem, at the loom, encircled,
like an Homeric princess, by her maids,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a> laughing,
chatting, or, along with them, exercising her sweet
voice in songs,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> those natural bursts of melody which
came spontaneously to the lips of a people whose
every-day speech resembled the music of the nightingale.</p>

<p class='c001'>Xenophon, in that interesting work, the Œconomics,
introduces an Athenian gentleman laying open to
Socrates the internal regulations of his family. In this
picture, the wife occupies an important position in
the foreground. She is, indeed, the principal figure
around which the various circumstances of the composition
are grouped with infinite delicacy and effect.
Young and beautiful she comes forth hesitating and
blushing at being detected in some slight economical
blunders. The husband takes her by the hand; they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>converse in our presence, and while the interior arrangements
of a Greek house are unreservedly laid
open, we discover the exact footing on which husband
and wife lived at Athens, and a state of more
complete confidence, of greater mutual affection, of
more considerate tenderness on the one side, or feminine
reliance and love on the other, it would be difficult
to conceive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ischomachos, I admit, is to be regarded as a favourable
specimen; he unites in his character the
qualities of an enterprising and enlightened country
gentleman, with those of a politician and orator
of no mean order, and his probity as a citizen infuses
an air of mingled grandeur and sweetness into
his domestic manners. Describing a conversation
which, soon after their marriage, took place between
him and his youthful wife, he observes:—“When
we had together taken a view of our possessions
I remarked to her that, without her constant care
and superintendence, nothing of all she had seen
would greatly profit us. And taking my illustration
from the science of politics, I showed that, in
well-regulated states, it is not deemed sufficient
that good laws are enacted, but that proper persons
are chosen to be guardians of those laws, who
not only reward with praise such as yield them
due obedience, but visit also their infraction with
punishment. Now, my love,” said I, “you must
consider yourself the guardian of our domestic
commonwealth, and dispose of all its resources as
the commander of a garrison disposes of the soldiers
under his orders. With you it entirely rests
to determine respecting the conduct of every individual
in the household, and, like a queen, to
bestow praise and reward on the dutiful and obedient,
while you keep in check the refractory by
punishment and reproof. Nor should this high
charge appear burdensome to you; for though
the duties of your station may seem to involve
deeper solicitude and necessity for greater exertion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>than we require even from a domestic, these greater
cares are rewarded by greater enjoyments; since,
whatever ability they may display in the improving
or protecting of their master’s property, the measure
of their advantages still depends upon his
will, while you, as its joint owner, enjoy the right
of applying it to whatever use you please. It follows,
therefore, that as the person most interested
in its preservation you should cheerfully encounter
superior difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Having listened attentively to the somewhat quaint
discourse of the Economist, Socrates felt anxious,
as well he might, to learn the result; for the lady,
expected thus wisely “to queen it,” was as yet but
fifteen. His faith, however, in womanhood was great;
and Xenophon, who but reflects from a less brilliant
mirror the Socratic wisdom, delivers, under the mask
of Ischomachos, the mingled convictions both of the
master and the pupil. The moral beauty of the dialogue,
and its truth to nature, would have been lost
had the lady at all shrunk from the duties of her
high office. But her ambition was at once awakened.
The obscurity to which, in the time of Pericles, women
were, by the manners of the country, condemned,
now no longer seemed desirable, and the love of fame
was urged upon her as a motive to extraordinary
exertions.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a> Her reply is highly characteristic. Running,
with the unerring tact of her sex, even in advance
of her husband, she desired him to believe that
he would have formed an extremely erroneous opinion
of her character, had he for a moment supposed
that the care of their common property could ever
have proved burdensome to her: on the contrary,
the really grievous thing would have been to require
her to be neglectful of it!</p>

<p class='c001'>Men always conceive they are complimenting a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>woman when they attribute to her a masculine understanding,
and they thus, in fact, do place her on the
highest intellectual level known to them. Socrates
adopted this style of compliment in speaking of the
wife of Ischomachos. And I may here remark, that
we need no other proof of how differently the Athenians
felt on the subject of women from the Orientals
with whom they have been compared, than the mere
circumstance of their conversing openly with strangers
respecting their wives. In the East, a greater affront
could scarcely be offered a man than to inquire about
his female establishment. The most an old friend
does is to say, “Is your house well?”—whereas at
Athens, women formed a never-failing theme in all
companies; which proves them to have been there
contemplated in a different light. In fact, the sentiments
of Ischomachos, every way worthy the most
chivalrous people of antiquity, could only have sprung
up in a society where just and exalted notions of
female virtue prevailed; for, under the word “high-mindedness,”
we find him grouping every refined and
estimable quality which a gentlewoman can possess.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, perhaps, the reader will not be displeased if
we introduce dramatically upon the scene an Athenian
married pair discussing in his presence a question
closely connected with domestic happiness. There
is little risk of exaggeration. The picture is by Xenophon,
a writer whose subdued and sober colouring
is calculated rather to diminish than otherwise the
poetical features of his subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>By Heaven! exclaimed Socrates, according to this
account, your wife’s understanding must be of a highly
masculine character.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nay, but suffer me, answered the husband, to place
before you a convincing proof of her high-mindedness,
by showing how, on a single representation, she
yielded to me on a subject extremely important.</p>

<p class='c001'>Proceed, cried the philosopher, (who had not found
Xantippe thus manageable,) proceed; for, believe
me, friend, I experience much greater delight in contemplating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the active virtues of a living woman, than
the most exquisite female form by the pencil of Zeuxis
would afford me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Observing, said Ischomachos, that my wife sought
by cosmetics<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a> and other arts of the toilette to render
herself fairer and ruddier than she had issued from
the hands of Nature, and that she wore high-heeled
shoes in order to add to her stature,—Tell me, wife,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
I began, would you now esteem me to be a worthy
participator of your fortunes if, concealing the true
state of my affairs, I aimed at appearing richer than
I am, by exhibiting to you heaps of false money,
necklaces of gilded wood for gold, and wardrobes of
spurious for genuine purple?</p>

<p class='c001'>Nay, exclaimed my wife, interrupting me, put not
the injurious supposition: it is what you could not be
guilty of. For, were such your character I could
never love you from my soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, by entering together into the bonds of marriage
are we not mutually invested with a property in
each other’s persons?</p>

<p class='c001'>People say so.</p>

<p class='c001'>They say truly: and since this is the case shall I
not more sincerely evince my esteem for you by
watching sedulously over my own health and well-being,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>and displaying to your gaze the natural hues
of a manly complexion, than if, neglecting these, I
presented myself with rouged cheeks, eyes encircled
by paint, and my whole exterior false and hollow?</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, she replied, I prefer the native colour of
your cheeks to any artificial bloom, and could never
gaze with so much delight into any eyes as into
yours—bright and sparkling with health.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then believe no less of me, said I; but be well
persuaded that, in my judgment, there are no tints
so beautiful as those with which nature has adorned
your cheeks. The same rule indeed holds universally.
For, even in the inferior creation, every living
thing delights most in individuals of its own species.
And so it is with man whom nothing so truly pleases
as to behold the image of his own nature mirrored
in another and a fairer form of humanity. Besides,
false beauties, though they may deceive the incurious
glance of strangers,<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> must inevitably be detected
by persons living always together. Women
necessarily appear undisguised when first rising in
the morning, before they have undergone the renovation
of the toilette; and perspiration, or tears, or
the waters of the bath, will even at other times
float away their artificial complexions.</p>

<p class='c001'>And what, in the name of all the gods, did she
say to that? inquired Socrates.</p>

<p class='c001'>What? replied the husband. Why, that for the
future she would abjure all meretricious ornaments,
and consent to appear decked with that simple grace
and beauty which she owed to nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Sparta married persons, as in France, occupied
separate beds; but among the Athenians and in
other parts of Greece a different custom prevailed.
The same remark may be applied to the Heroic
Ages. Odysseus and Penelope, Alcinoös and Arete,
Paris and Helen, occupy the same chamber and the
same couch. The women in the Lysistrata of Aristophanes
appealed to this circumstance in justification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of their late appearance at the female assembly
held before day, and Euphiletos in the oration of
Lysias on Eratosthenes’ murder, who admits us freely
into the recesses of the harem, confirms this fact,
except, that when the mother suckled her own child
she usually slept with it in a separate bed. At
Byzantium also the same practice prevailed, as we
learn from a very amusing anecdote. Python an
orator of that city who, like Falstaff, seems to have
been somewhere about two yards in the waist, once
quelled an insurrection by a jocular allusion to this
part of domestic economy. “My dear fellow-citizens,”
cried he to the enraged multitude, “you see
how fat I am. Well! my wife is still fatter than
I, yet when we agree one small bed will contain
us both; but, if we once begin to quarrel, the
whole house is too little to hold us.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen above how absolute was the authority
of women over their household, and this
authority likewise extended to their children. The
father no doubt could exercise, when he chose,
considerable influence; but as most of his time was
spent abroad, in business or politics, the chief charge
of their early education, the first training of their
intellect, the first rooting of their morals and shaping
of their principles devolved upon the mother.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
There have been writers, indeed, to whom this has
seemed a circumstance to be lamented. But their
judgment probably was warped by theory. In the
original discipline of the mind, great attainments
and experience of the world are less needed than
tact to discern, and patience to apply, those minute
incentives to action which women discover with a
truer sagacity than we do. In this task, ever pleasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to a true mother, the aid of nurses, however, was
usually obtained; nor are we, as Cramer observes, on
this account to blame the Athenian ladies, so long
as they did not, as in after times was too much the
fashion, consider their whole duty performed when
they had delivered their children to the nurse.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will be evident from what has been said, that
an Athenian lady who conscientiously discharged her
duties was very little exposed to ennui. She arose
in the morning with the lark, roused her slaves, distributed
to all their tasks,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a> superintended the operations
of the nursery, and, on days frequently recurring,
went abroad in the performance of rites specially allotted
to her sex. But, one effect of democracy is
to confer undue influence upon women.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a> And this
influence, where by education or otherwise they happen
to be luxurious or vain, must infallibly prove
pernicious to the state. At Athens, the number of
this class of women, extremely limited in the beginning,
augmented rapidly during the decline of
the republic, and the comic poets substituting a
part for the whole, invest their countrywomen generally
with the qualities belonging exclusively to these.—But,
the success of such writers depending generally
on ingenious extravagance and exaggeration, we
must be on our guard against their insinuations.
Their faith in the existence of virtue, male or female,
has, in all ages, if we are to judge by their
works, been very lanksided. In their view, if there
has been one good woman since the world began, it
is as much as there has. Accordingly when these
lively caricaturists describe the female <em>demos</em> as addicted
extravagantly to wine<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a> and pawning their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>wardrobe to purchase it—as compelling the men by
their intemperance to keep their cellars under lock
and key, and still defeating them by manufacturing
false ones—as forming illicit connexions, and having
recourse to the boldest stratagems in furtherance of
their intrigues, we must necessarily suppose them to
have amused themselves at the expense of truth;
though that, among the Athenians, there were examples
enough of women of whom all this might
be said, it would be absurd to deny.</p>

<p class='c001'>We know that where the minds of married dames
are fixed chiefly upon dress and show their anxiety
has often very little reference to their husbands.
And if it be their object to excite admiration out
of doors, it is simply as a means to an end, which
end, in too many cases, is intrigue. Proofs exist
that among the Athenian ladies there were numbers
whose idle lives and luxurious habits produced
their natural results—loose principles and dissolute
manners. The beauty of Alcibiades drew them after
him in crowds,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a> though we do not read that, like
another very handsome personage in a modern republic,
the son of Cleinias found it necessary to carry
about a club to defend himself from their importunities.
They went abroad elaborately habited and
adorned merely to attract the gaze of men,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a> and
having thus sown the first seeds of intrigue, they
took care to cultivate and bring them to maturity.
The felicitous invention of Falstaff’s friends, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>got him safe out of Ford’s house in a buck-basket,
was not so new as Shakspeare, perhaps, imagined.
His predecessors on the Athenian stage had already
discovered stratagems equally happy among their
countrywomen, whose lovers we find made their way
into the harem wrapped up in straw, like carp—or
crept through holes made purposely by fair hands
in the eaves—or scaled the envious walls by the
help of those vulgar contrivances called ladders.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The laws of Athens, however, were more modest
than its women. For, from the very interference
of the laws, it is evident, that the example of the
Spartan ladies, who enjoyed the privilege of exposing
themselves indecently, found numerous imitators
among the female democracy. To repress this unbecoming
taste, it was enacted, that any woman detected
in the streets in indecorous deshabille<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a> should
be fined a thousand drachmæ, and, to add disgrace
to pecuniary considerations, the name of the offender,
with the amount of the fine, was inscribed on a tablet
and suspended on a certain platane tree in the
Cerameicos. However, what constituted <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>indecorous
deshabille</i></span> in the opinion of Philippides, who procured
the enactment of the law, it might be difficult to
determine. Possibly it may have consisted in the
too great exposure of the bosom, for the covering
of which ladies in remoter ages appear to have depended
very much on their veils. Thus in the interview
of Helen with Aphrodite she saw, says the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>poet, her beautiful neck, desire-inflaming bosom, and
eyes bright with liquid splendour. Her garments concealed
the rest.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a> Now, as it was customary for ladies
to appear veiled in public, the object of the law of
Philippides may simply have been to enforce the observance
of this ancient practice. The magistrates
who presided over this very delicate part of Athenian
police were denominated “Regulators of the
women,”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a> an office which Sultan Mahmood in our
day took upon himself. They were chosen by the
twenty from among the wealthiest and most virtuous
of the citizens, and in their office resembled
the Roman Censors and similar magistrates in several
other states.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The evil influence of women of this description,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
who, as Milton expresses it, would fain at any
rate ride in their coach and six, was perceived and
lamented by the philosophers. To their vain and
frivolous notions might be traced, in part at least, the
love of power, of trifling distinctions, of unmanly
pleasures, which infected the Athenians towards the
decline of their republic. By them the springs of
education were poisoned, and the seeds sown of those
inordinate artificial desires which convulse and overthrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>states. In vain did philosophers inculcate
temperance and moderation, while the youth were
imbued with different opinions by their mothers.
The lessons of the Academy were overgrown and
checked in the harem. Such dames no doubt would
grieve to find their husbands content with little<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> (as
was the case with Xantippe) and not numbered
with the rulers, since their consequence among their
own sex was thus lessened. They would have had
them keen worshipers of Mammon, eagerly squabbling
and wrangling in the law-courts or the ecclesiæ,
not cultivators of domestic habits or philosophical
tranquillity and content: and in conversing
with their sons would be careful to recommend
maxims the reverse of the father’s, with all the cant
familiar to women of their character.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Our review of female society at Athens would
be incomplete were we to overlook the Hetairæ
who exerted so powerful an influence over the morals
and destinies of the state. They occupied
much the same position which the same class of
females still do in modern communities, cultivated
in mind, polished and elegant in manners, but scarcely
deserving as a body to be viewed in the light
in which a very distinguished historian has placed
them.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Their position, however, was anomalous, resembling
rather that of kings’ mistresses in modern
times, whose vices are tolerated on account of their
rank, than that of plebeian sinners whose deficiencies
in birth and fortune exclude them from good society.
There is much difficulty in rightly apprehending
the notions of the ancients on the subject
of these women. At first sight we are shocked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to find that, during one festival, they were permitted
to enter the temples in company with modest
ladies. But in what Christian country are they excluded
from church?<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Again, behold in our theatres
the matron and the courtezan in the same box,
while at Athens even foreign women were not suffered
to approach the space set apart for the female
citizens. Nevertheless, though on this point
so rigid, they were in their own houses permitted
occasionally to visit them<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and receive instructions
from their lips, as in Turkish harems ladies do from
the Almè.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not permitted here to lift the curtain from
the manners of these ladies. But their position,
pregnant with evil to the state through its contaminating
influences on the minds of youth, must
be comprehensively explained before a correct idea
can be formed of the internal structure of the
Athenian commonwealth, of the germs of dissolution
which it concealed within its own bosom, or the
premature blight which an unspiritual system of
morals was mainly instrumental in producing. No
doubt the question whether the existence of such
a class of persons should be tolerated at all, is
environed by difficulties almost insurmountable.
They have always existed and therefore, perhaps,
it is allowable to infer that they always will exist;
but this does not seem to justify Solon for sanctioning,
by legislative enactments, a modification of moral
turpitude debasing to the individual, and consequently
detrimental to the state. To do evil that good
may come, is as much a solecism in politics as in
ethics. On this point I miss the habitual wisdom
of the Athenian legislator. Lycurgus himself could
have enacted nothing more at variance with just
principles, or more subversive of heroic sentiments.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The Hetairæ,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a> recognised by law and scarcely
proscribed by public opinion, may be said to have
constituted a sort of monarchical leaven in the very
heart of the republic; they shared with the sophists,
whom I have already depicted, the affections of the
lax ambitious youths, panting at once for pleasure
and distinction, fostered expensive tastes and luxurious
habits, increased consequently their aptitude to indulge
in peculation, shared with the unprincipled
the spoils of the state, and vigorously paved the way
for the battle of Chæronea. But if their existence
was hurtful to the community, so was it often full
of bitterness to themselves. In youth, no doubt,
when beauty breathed its spell around them, they
were puffed up and intoxicated with the incense of
flattery<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a>—their conversation at once sprightly and
learned seemed full of charms—their houses spacious
as palaces and splendidly adorned were the
resort of the gay, the witty, the powerful, nay, even
of the wise—for Socrates did not disdain to converse
with Theodota or to imbibe the maxims of
eloquence from Aspasia. But when old age came
on, what were they? It then appeared, that the
lively repartees and grotesque extravagancies which
had pleased when proceeding from beautiful lips,
seemed vapid and poor from an old woman. The
wrinkles which deformed their features were equally
fatal to their wisdom that flitted from their dwellings,
and became domiciliated with the last beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>importation from Ionia. Thus deserted, the most
celebrated Hetairæ became a butt for the satire even
of the most clownish. The wit wont to set the
table in a roar scarcely served to defend them
against the jests of the agora.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you sell your beef?” said Laïs to a
young butcher in the flesh-market.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Three obels the <em>Hag</em>,” answered the coxcomb.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how dare you, said the faded beauty, here
in Athens pretend to make use of barbarian weights?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The word in the original signifying an old woman
and a Carian weight, it suited her purpose to understand
him in the latter sense.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Worshiped and slighted alternately they adopted
narrow and interested principles in self-defence. Besides,
generally barbarians by birth, they brought along
with them from their original homes the creed best
suited to their calling—“Let us eat and drink for
to-morrow we die.” They were often the lumber
of Asia and hence known under the appellation of
“strange women,” though it is very certain, that
many female citizens were from time to time enrolled
among their ranks, some through the pressure
of adversity, others from a preference for that
kind of life. Their education it must be conceded,
however, was far more masculine than that of other
women. They cultivated all the sciences but that
of morals, and concealed their lack of modesty by
the dazzling splendour of their wit. Hence among
a people with whom intellect was almost everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>their company was much sought after and highly
valued, not habitually perhaps by statesmen, but by
wits, poets, sophists, and young men of fashion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bons mots</i></span> uttered by those ladies
have been preserved. One day at table Stilpo the
philosopher accused Glycera of corrupting the manners
of youth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My friend,” said she, “we are both to blame;
for you, in your turn, corrupt their minds by innumerable
forms of sophistry and error. And if men be
rendered unhappy, what signifies it whether a philosopher
or a courtezan be the cause?”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to her that a joke, somewhat hackneyed but
seldom attributed to its real author, was originally
due. A gentleman presenting her with a very small
jar of wine sought to enhance its value by pretending
it was sixteen years old. “Then,” replied she, “it is
extremely little for its age.” Gnathena too, another
member of the sisterhood, sprinkled her conversation
with sparkling wit, but too redolent of the profession
to be retailed. Some of her sayings, however, will
bear transplantation, though they must suffer by it.
To stop the mouth of a babbler who observed that
he had just arrived from the Hellespont—“And yet,”
she remarked, “it is clear to me that you know
nothing of one of its principal cities!” “Which
city is that?”—“Sigeion,”<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a> (in which there appears
to be a reference to the word Silence) answered
Gnathena. Several noisy gallants, who being in her
debt sought to terrify her by menaces, once saying
they would pull her house down, and had pickaxes and
mattocks ready, “I disbelieve it,” she replied, “for
if you had, you would have pledged them to pay what
you owe me.” A comic poet remarking to one of
these ladies that the water of her cistern was delightfully
cold—“It has always been so,” she replied,
“since we have got into the habit of throwing
your plays into it.” The repartee of Melitta
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to a conceited person who was said to have fled
ignominiously from the field of battle is exceedingly
keen. Happening to be eating of a hare which
she seemed much to enjoy, our soldier, desirous of directing
attention to her, inquired if she knew what
was the fleetest animal in the world. “The runaway,”
replied Melitta.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same taste which induces many persons of
rank in our own day to marry opera dancers and
actresses, in antiquity favoured the ambition of the
Hetairæ, many of whom rose from their state of
humiliation to be the wives of satraps and princes.
This was the case with Glycera, whom after the
death of Pythionica, Harpalos sent for from Athens,
and domiciliated within his royal palace at Tarsos.
He required her to be saluted and considered as
his queen, and refused to be crowned unless in
conjunction with her. Nay, he had even the hardihood
to erect in the city of Rossos, a brazen
statue to her, beside his own.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a> Herpyllis, one of
the same sisterhood, won the heart of Aristotle, and
was the mother of Nicomachos. She survived the
philosopher, and was carefully provided for by his
will.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Even Plato, whose genius and virtue are still
the admiration of mankind, succumbed to the charms
of Archæanassa, an Hetaira of Colophon, whose beauty,
which long survived her youth, he celebrated in
an epigram still extant.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of all these ladies, however, not even excepting
Phryne, or the Sicilian Laïs,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a> Aspasia<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a> has obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the most widely extended fame. This illustrious
woman, endowed by nature with a mind still more
beautiful than her beautiful form, exercised over
the fortunes of Athens an influence beyond the
reach of the greatest queen. Her genius, unobserved
for some time, by degrees drew around her all
those whom the love of letters or ambition induced
to cultivate their minds. Her house became a sort
of club-room, where eloquence, politics, philosophy,
mixed with badinage, were daily discussed, and
whither even ladies of the highest rank resorted
to acquire from Aspasia those accomplishments which
were already beginning to be in fashion. From her
Socrates professed to have in part acquired his knowledge
of rhetoric, and it is extremely probable that
he could trace to the habit of conversing with one
so gifted by nature, so polished by rare society,
something of that exquisite facility and lightness of
manner which characterize his familiar dialectics.
No doubt, we may attribute something of the reputation
she acquired to the desire to disparage Pericles.
It was thought that by appropriating many of his
harangues to her they could bring him down nearer
their own level. She was, in influence and celebrity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the Madame Roland of Athens, though living in
times somewhat less troubled.</p>

<p class='c001'>The name of Phryne, though not so celebrated, is
still familiar to every one, partly, perhaps, through
the accusation brought against her in the court of
Heliæa,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a> by Euthios. She was a native of Thespiæ,
but established at Athens, and beloved by
the orator Hyperides, who undertook her defence.
His pleading, it may therefore be presumed, was
eloquent. Perceiving, however, he could make but
little impression on the judges, he had her called
into court, and, as if by accident, bared her bosom,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
the fairness and beauty of which heaving with anguish
and terror—for it was a matter of life and
death—so wrought upon the august judges that her
acquittal immediately followed. The Heliasts, renowned
for their upright decisions, were suspected
on this occasion of undue commiseration, though
the charge was probably grounded on some frivolous
pretence of impiety; and, to prevent the recurrence
of similar partiality in future, a decree was passed,
rendering it illegal thus to extort the pity of the
court, or, on any account, to introduce the accused,
whether man or woman, into the presence of the
judges. It was on her figure that Apelles chiefly
relied in painting his Aphrodite rising from the
sea, as Phryne herself rose before all Greece on the
beach at Eleusis; and Praxiteles also wrought from
the same model his Cnidean Aphrodite.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a> This
sculptor, who was the rival of Hyperides, and, indeed,
of all Athens, in the affections of Phryne,
permitted her one day to make choice for herself
from two statues of his own workmanship—the
Eros and the Satyr. Discovering, by a stratagem,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that he himself preferred the former, she was guided
by his judgment, and dedicated the winged god in
a temple of her native city. In admiration of
her beauty, a number of gentlemen erected, by subscription,
in her honour, a golden statue at Delphi.
It was the work of Praxiteles, and stood on a
pillar of white marble of Pentelicos, between the
statues of Archidamos, king of Sparta, and Philip,
son of Amyntas. The inscription ran simply thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Phryne, of Thespiæ, daughter of Epicles.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>On seeing this statue, Crates, the cynic, exclaimed,
“Behold a trophy of Hellenic wantonness!”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not, of course, among women of this class,
that we should expect to discover proofs of female
truth or enduring attachment. But the human heart
sometimes triumphs over adverse circumstances.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c012'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
History has preserved the memory of more than
one act of heroism performed by an Hetaira, to
show that woman doth not always put off her other
virtues, though habitually trampling on the one which
constitutes for her the boundary between honour
and infamy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ptolemy, son of Philadelphos, while commanding
the garrison of Ephesos, had along with him the
courtezan, Irene, who, when his Thracian mercenaries
rose in revolt, fled along with him to
the temple of Artemis, where they fell together,
sprinkling the altar with their blood.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c012'><sup>[132]</sup></a> Alcibiades,
too, of all his friends, found none adhere to him in
his adversity but an Hetaira, who cheerfully exposed
her life for his sake; and, when the assassins
of Pharnabazos had achieved their task, performed,
like another Antigone, the last duties over the ashes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of the man she loved.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c012'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Other anecdotes might be
added equally honourable to their feelings and fidelity,
but these will sufficiently illustrate their character
and the estimation in which they were generally
held.</p>

nose inclined to aquiline, (ἐπίγρυπος)
and small delicate ears.
Nothing could be softer than her
skin, and her complexion was
fresh as the rose; on which account
the Phoceans called her
Milto, or ‘the Blooming’. Her
ruddy lips, opening, disclosed
teeth whiter than snow. She,
moreover, possessed the charm
on which Homer so often dwells
in his descriptions of beautiful
women, of small, well-formed
ankles. Her voice was so full of
music and sweetness, that those
to whom she spoke imagined
they heard the songs of the
Seirens. To crown all she was
like Horace’s Pyrrha, simplex
munditiis, abhorring superfluous
pomp of ornament.”—Hist. Var.

of Milto:—thus, the youth in Terence

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> TOILETTE, DRESS, AND ORNAMENTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Having now described the condition and influence
of women, it will be necessary to institute
some inquiry into one of the principal means by
which they achieved and maintained their empire.
At first sight, perhaps, the disquisition may appear
scarcely to deserve all the pains I have bestowed
upon it; but, as the dress of the ancients is connected
on the one hand with the progress of the
useful arts, as spinning, weaving, dyeing, &amp;c., and
on the other with the forms and developement of
sculpture, it can scarcely, when well considered, be
reckoned among matters of trifling moment. Besides,
the costume and ornaments of a people often
afford important aid towards comprehending the national
character, constituting, in fact, a sort of practical
commentary on the mental habits, and tone
and principles of morals, prevailing at any given
period among them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The raiment of the Grecian women, of which the
public generally obtain some idea from the remaining
monuments of ancient art, may be said to have
been regulated by the same laws of taste which
presided over the developement of the national genius
in sculpture and painting. Every article of
their habiliment appeared to harmonise exactly with
the rest. Nothing of that grotesque extravagance
which in some of the fleeting vagaries of fashion
transforms our modern ladies, with their inflated
balloon sleeves and painfully deformed waists, into
so many whalebone and muslin hobgoblins, was
ever allowed to disfigure the rich contour of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Greek woman. As she proceeded lovely from the
hands of nature, her pride was to preserve that
loveliness. Her garments, accordingly, were not
fashioned with a view to disguise or conceal her
form, but by graceful folds, flowing curves, ornaments
rich and tastefully disposed, to afford as
many indications of its matchless symmetry and
perfection as might be compatible with her sex’s
delicacy and the severity of public morals. Consequently
the art of dress, like every other conversant
with taste and beauty, reached in Greece its
highest perfection. A woman draped according to
the prevalent fashion in the best ages of the Athenian
commonwealth, was an object not to be equalled
for elegance or grace. From the snow white veil
which probably shaded her countenance and ringlets
of auburn or hyacinth, to the sandals of white satin
and gold that ornamented her small ankle, the eye
could detect nothing gaudy, affected, or out of keeping.
There was magnificence without ostentation,
brilliance of colours, but a brilliance that harmonised
with whatever was brought in contact with
it; the splendour of numerous jewels and trinkets
of gold, but no appearance of display, or of a wish
to dazzle. Everything appeared to stand where it
did, because it was its proper place.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in Sparta where there existed little tendency
towards art or refinement,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c012'><sup>[134]</sup></a> a costume the antipodes
of all this prevailed. That of the virgins differed
in some respects from that of the matrons, and
the difference arose out of a peculiar feature of
manners, in which, if in nothing else, they resembled
the English. In several Ionic countries, as
at present on the continent, girls were previously
to marriage guarded with much strictness. At
Sparta, on the contrary, and among the Dorians
generally,<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c012'><sup>[135]</sup></a> they were permitted, as in England, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>walk abroad in company with young men, and, of
course, to form attachments at their own discretion.
In this, too, as in their dress, they only preserved
the customs of antiquity; for in Homer we
find the Trojan ladies making anxious inquiries of
Hector respecting their relations and friends in the
field, and going forth from their houses attended
only by their maids. The married women led more
retired lives, and when they went abroad fashion
required that they should be veiled, as we learn
from the following apophthegm of Charillos, who
being asked why the maidens went abroad uncovered
while the matrons concealed their faces, replied:
“Because it is incumbent on the former to
find themselves husbands, on the latter only to
keep those they have.”<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c012'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The principal, or, rather, the sole garment of the
Dorian maidens was the chiton, or himation,<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a> made
of woollen stuff, and without sleeves, but fastened
on either shoulder by a large clasp, and gathered
on the breast by a kind of brooch. This sleeveless
robe, which seldom reached more than half way to
the knee, was moreover left open up to a certain
point on both sides,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c012'><sup>[138]</sup></a> so that the skirts or wings,
flying open as they walked, entirely exposed their
limbs, closely resembling the shift of the Bedouin
women,<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a> slit up to the arm-pit, but gathered tight
by a girdle about the waist. When the girdle was
removed it reached to the calves of the legs,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c012'><sup>[140]</sup></a> and
would then, but for the side-slits, have been quite
as becoming as the blue chemise of the modern
Egyptian women, which is open in front from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>neck to the waist.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c012'><sup>[141]</sup></a> When dressed in this single
robe, their whole form breathing health, and modesty
in their countenance, there was no doubt a simple
elegance in their appearance, little less attractive,
perhaps, than the exquisite and elaborate <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mise</i></span> of
an Ionian or an Attic girl. In this costume Melissa,
daughter of Procles, of Epidaurus, was habited
when, as she poured out wine to her father’s labourers,
Periander, the Corinthian,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c012'><sup>[142]</sup></a> beheld and loved
her. The married women, however, did not make
their appearance in public <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en chemise</i></span>, but when
going abroad donned a second garment which seems
to have resembled pretty closely their husbands’
himatia.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c012'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the simple wardrobe of a Doric lady, which
in ancient times was that of all women of Hellenic
race, exceedingly little can be said. It is altogether
different with respect to that of the gentlewomen
of Attica, where, though inferior in personal beauty
to none, the women exhibited so much fertility in
the matter of dress, that they appeared to depend
on that alone for the establishment of their empire.
For this reason it would be vain to pretend
to describe all their vestments and ornaments, or the
arts of the toilette by which they were adapted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>their purposes. To do so properly would, in fact,
require a volume. But all that can be crowded into
one short chapter shall be given, since I am not
deterred by any such scruples as formerly arrested
the pen of a very learned writer, who apprehended
that, if he proceeded, he might be supposed to have
been rummaging the boudoir notes of an Athenian
lady!<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The primary garment,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a> answering to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chemise</i></span>
of the moderns, was a white tunic reaching to the
ground,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c012'><sup>[146]</sup></a> in some instances sleeveless, and fastened
on the shoulders with buttons, in others furnished
with loose hanging sleeves descending to the wrist,
and brought together at intervals upon the arm by
silver or golden agraffes.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a> It was gathered into
close folds under the bosom by a girdle,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c012'><sup>[148]</sup></a> or riband,
sometimes fastened in front by a knot, sometimes
by a clasp.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c012'><sup>[149]</sup></a> This inner robe, made in the earlier
ages of fine linen,<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c012'><sup>[150]</sup></a> manufactured in Attica, or imported
from Tyre, Egypt, or Sidon, came, in after
times, to be of muslin from Tarentum, or woven at
home from Egyptian cotton. The use of linen, however,
for this purpose was not wholly superseded.
A very beautiful kind, from the island of Amorgos,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c012'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
one of the Cyclades, was often substituted down to
a very late period in place of the byssos, or fine
muslin of Egypt; and this insular fabric,<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c012'><sup>[152]</sup></a> whether
snow-white or purple, would have rivalled the finest
cambric, being of the most delicate texture and
semi-transparent,<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c012'><sup>[153]</sup></a> like the Tarentine and Coan vests
of the Roman ladies, the sandyx-coloured Lydian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>robe, or the silken chemises of the Turkish sultanas,
described by Lady Montague.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c012'><sup>[154]</sup></a> It is in a tunic of
this linen that Lysistrata, in Aristophanes, advises
the Athenian ladies to appear before their husbands
in order to give full effect to the splendour of
their charms.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c012'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Because the Amorginean linen was often, perhaps
commonly, dyed purple, it has been inferred, that
none purely white was produced; but this, as Bochart<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c012'><sup>[156]</sup></a>
observes, is, probably, a mistake. At all events, it
was of extraordinary fineness, superior, in the opinion
of Suidas,<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a> even to the byssos and carbasos, or
lawn of Cyprus, and appears to have been of a thin,
gauze-like texture, like the drapery of “woven air”
which Petronius<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c012'><sup>[158]</sup></a> throws around his female characters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over the chiton was worn a shorter robe not
reaching below the knee, and confined above the
loins by a broad riband. This also was, in some
instances, furnished with sleeves, and of a rich purple
or saffron colour, generally ornamented, like the
chiton, with a broad border of variegated embroidery.
To these, in order to complete the walking-dress,
was added a magnificent mantle, generally
purple, embroidered with gold, which, being thrown
negligently over the shoulders,<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c012'><sup>[159]</sup></a> floated airily about
the person, discovering the under garments exquisitely
disposed for the purpose of displaying all the
contours of the form, particularly of the waist and
bosom. The Athenian ladies being, like our own,
peculiarly jealous of possessing the reputation of a
fine figure, and nature sometimes failing them, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>recourse to art, and wore what, among milliners, I
believe, are called <em>bustles</em>.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c012'><sup>[160]</sup></a> I am sorry to be obliged
to add, that there were, also, mothers at Athens
who anticipated us in the absurdity of tight lacing,
and invented corsets for the purpose of compressing
the abdomen and otherwise reducing the figures of
their daughters to some artificial standard which
they had already begun to set up in defiance of
nature.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c012'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Some women, too, when apprehensive of
growing fat, would collect on fine wool a quantity
of summer dew, which they afterwards squeezed out
and drank, this liquid having been supposed to be
possessed of deleterious qualities, more particularly
the ascending dew.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Like the eastern ladies of the present day, they
seldom went abroad without their veil, which was
a light fabric of transparent texture, white or purple,
from Cos, or Laconia. It was thrown tastefully over
the head, raised in front on the point of the sphendone,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c012'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
as in modern Italy by the comb, and hung
waving on the shoulders and down the back in
glittering folds. But this was not the only covering
they made use of for their head. Those modern
writers who have so thought are mistaken, since it
is clear, both from contemporary testimony and numerous
works of art still remaining, that very frequently
they wore caps or bonnets. Several examples
occur in Mr. Hope’s work, on the Costumes of
the Ancients;<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a> and Mnesilochos, in Aristophanes,
when putting on the disguise of a woman for the
purpose of being present at the Festival of Demeter,
like Clodius at that of the Bona Dea, desires
to borrow from Agathon a net or mitre for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>head. “Will you have my night-cap?” inquires the
poet. “Exactly,” replies Euripides, “that is just
what we want.”<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But we have hitherto scarcely entered upon the
list of their wardrobe, in enumerating some of the
articles of which, I must crave the reader’s permission
to employ the original terms, our language,
in most cases, furnishing us with no equivalent.
And, first, following the order of Pollux, who observes
no principle of classification, we have the
<em>Epomis</em>, a robe with sleeves, opposed to the <em>Exomis</em>,
which had none. The <em>Diploïdion</em>, an ample cloak,
or mantle, capacious enough to be worn double.
The <em>Hemidiploïdion</em>, a more scanty mantle; the
<em>Katastiktos</em>, adorned with flowers or figures of animals,
or richly marked with spots, the <em>Katagogis</em>,
the <em>Epiblema</em>, or cloak, and the <em>Peplos</em>,<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c012'><sup>[166]</sup></a> a word of
very equivocal character, used to signify a veil or
mantle, a sofa-carpet, or a covering for a chariot.
Generally, it seems to have designated a garment
of double the necessary size, that, at pleasure, it
might be put on, or cast, like a cloak, over the
whole body, as appears from the Peplos of Athena.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c012'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
That the word sometimes was used to signify a
tunic appears from Xenophon, who says “the peplos
being rent above, the bosom appeared.”<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c012'><sup>[168]</sup></a> He, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>considers it to have formed part of the male
costume.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another article of female dress was the <em>Zoma</em>, a
short vest fitting close to the shape, and adorned at
the bottom with fringe, as appears from a fragment
of Æschylus in the Onomasticon. A character of Menander,
too, exclaims,—“Don’t you perceive the nurse
habited in her Zoma?”—for, adds Pollux, it was generally
worn by old women. An elegant woollen dress,
called <em>Parapechu</em>, white, but with purple sleeves, was
imported from Corinth, and would appear to have
been much worn by the Hetairæ.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c012'><sup>[169]</sup></a> Other garments
seem to have been affected by the middle class of
citizens, who, being unable to dress in purple,<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c012'><sup>[170]</sup></a> the
distinguishing colour of the wealthy and the noble,
brought into fashion the <em>Paruphes</em> and <em>Paralourges</em>,
robes adorned on either side with a purple stripe.
As much dignity is supposed to belong to ample
drapery, our citizen ladies took care not to be sparing
of stuff, their dresses trailing to the ground, and
displaying numerous folds, produced purposely at the
extremity by a band passing round the edge. These
garments were generally of linen; but when a lady,
in Homer, is said to be wrapped in her shining mantle,
the poet<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c012'><sup>[171]</sup></a> is supposed to intend a fine, light, woollen
cloak, like the white burnooses of the Tunisian and
Egyptian ladies.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c012'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Several sorts of dresses obtained their appellation
from their colours; as the <em>Crocotos</em>, a saffron robe of
ceremony, the <em>Crocotion</em>, a diminutive of the same;
the <em>Omphakinon</em>, of the colour of unripe grapes,
which, though prescriptively appropriated to women,
was much affected by Alexander the Great. Modern
ladies have delighted in flea-coloured dresses, and, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>like manner, the ancients had theirs of asinine hue,
called <em>Killios</em>, from a Doric name for the ass, and
afterwards <em>Onagrinos</em>,<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c012'><sup>[173]</sup></a> which, if they really resembled
the wild ass in hue, must have been exceedingly beautiful.
There was a scarlet robe, with the appellation
of <em>Coccobaphes</em>, the <em>Sisys</em>, a thick heavy cloak, likewise
called <em>Hyphandron Himation</em>, resembling the
<em>Amphimallos</em>, which had a double warp, and was hairy
on both sides.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c012'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Not to extend this list of dresses beyond the patience
of a milliner, we will now pass on to the principal
ornaments for the head,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c012'><sup>[175]</sup></a> in which the Greek
ladies evinced extraordinary taste and invention.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c012'><sup>[176]</sup></a>
Among these one of the most elegant was the <em>Ampyx</em>,
a fillet by which they confined their hair in front.
It sometimes consisted of a piece of gold embroidery,
the place of which was often supplied by a thin plate
of pure gold, studded with jewels. Another Homeric
ornament, the <em>Kekruphalos</em>,<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c012'><sup>[177]</sup></a> can only be alluded to as
a critical puzzle which has baffled all the commentators,
in which predicament the <em>Plekte anadesme</em><a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c012'><sup>[178]</sup></a> also
stands; all that we know being, that it found its place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in the female head-dress, though whether as a mitre
or a diadem Apollonios is unable to determine. It
may possibly have been, under another appellation,
that graceful wreath or garland, consisting of fragrant
flowers interwoven or bound together by their stems,
described among female ornaments by Pollux.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c012'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another article of the same ambiguous character
was the <em>Pylæon</em>, supposed to have derived its name
from φύλον, <em>a leaf</em>. Athenæus,<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c012'><sup>[180]</sup></a> on a subject of this
kind, perhaps, one of the best authorities, describes it
as the crown which, during certain festivals, the Spartans
placed upon the head of Hera. Doubtless, however,
the most tasteful and elegant of this class of
female ornaments was the <em>Kalyx</em>, a golden syrinx or
reed, passed like a ring over each several tress to
keep it separate.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c012'><sup>[181]</sup></a> Eustathius describes it as a ring
resembling a full-blown, but not expanded, rose; and
this explanation will not be inconsistent with that of
Hesychius, if we suppose the golden tubes to have
terminated in the form of that flower. The <em>Strophion</em>
was a band or fillet<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c012'><sup>[182]</sup></a> with which women confined
their hair, as we discover from many ancient statues.
Parrhasios the artist, who used to bind his luxuriant
locks with a white strophion, was therefore accused
of effeminacy.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c012'><sup>[183]</sup></a> The name, however, appears to have
been applied to any kind of band, even to the broad
belt worn to support the bosom: “My strophion
being untied the walnuts fell out,” says the girl in
Aristophanes.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c012'><sup>[184]</sup></a> There was also an ornament of the
same name worn by priests.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c012'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>The <em>Opisthosphendone</em>,<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c012'><sup>[186]</sup></a> one of the female ornaments
enumerated in a fragment of Aristophanes,
was worn only on the stage. Its proper name <em>sphendone</em>
it derived from its resemblance to a sling,
being broad and elevated in front,<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c012'><sup>[187]</sup></a> and terminating
in narrow points at the back of the head where it
was tied. On the comic stage it was sometimes
worn for sport with the fore part behind.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a> The
<em>Anadesma</em><a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c012'><sup>[189]</sup></a> was a gilded fillet or diadem of gold,
used like the <em>strophion</em> for encircling the forehead.
What was the precise use or form of the <em>Xanion</em>,
another golden ornament fashionable in remote antiquity,
could not be ascertained in the age of Pollux,
who says that many writers supposed it to have
been a <a id='corr61.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='comb'>comb.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_61.15'><ins class='correction' title='comb'>comb.</ins></a></span> Of this number are Hesychius,
Suidas,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c012'><sup>[190]</sup></a> and Phavorinus. But a learned modern
conjectures with more probability, that it was some
talismanic idol worn as a spell against the evil eye.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c012'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
In fact it is expressly observed in the Etymologicon
Magnum,<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c012'><sup>[192]</sup></a> that the Hellenic women reckoned it
among their phylacteries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the ear-rings worn by Grecian women the
variety was very great. The most ancient kind
were called <em>Hermata</em>, of which mention occurs both
in the Iliad and the Odyssey.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c012'><sup>[193]</sup></a> They were usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>adorned with three emerald drops,<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c012'><sup>[194]</sup></a> for which reason
they were by the Athenians denominated <em>Triopia</em>
or <em>Triopides</em>,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c012'><sup>[195]</sup></a> and by the other Greeks <em>Triopthalma</em>
or “the triple eye.” By this word, as an ancient
grammarian informs us, some understood an animal
like the beetle, supposed to have three eyes, whence
a necklace with three hyaline or crystal eyes, depending
from it in front, was likewise called by the
same name. Pollux<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c012'><sup>[196]</sup></a> supposed the earrings of Hera
to have been adorned with three diminutive figures
in precious stones, or gold, probably of goddesses.
The <em>Diopos</em> seems to have been an earring with two
drops. The <em>Helix</em> appears in Homer<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c012'><sup>[197]</sup></a> rather to mean
an earring than an armlet, and to have received its
name from its circular shape or curvature; but the
spiral gold rings round the walking-stick of Parrhasios
are also called <em>Helices</em> by Athenæus.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c012'><sup>[198]</sup></a> Another name
for this sort of earring was <em>Heliktes</em>.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c012'><sup>[199]</sup></a> In the Æolic
dialect earrings were called <em>Siglai</em>, in the Doric <em>Artiala</em>.
A particular kind denominated <em>Enclastridia</em>
and <em>Strobelia</em>, by the comic poets, had gold drops in
the form of a pine cone.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c012'><sup>[200]</sup></a> Two very curious kinds
of earrings were the <em>Caryatides</em>, and the <em>Hippocampia</em>,
the former representing in miniature the architectural
figures, so called, the latter little horses
with tails ending in a fish. There were earrings,
likewise, with drops in the forms of centaurs and
other fantastic creations.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c012'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The names and figures of necklaces were scarcely
less numerous.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c012'><sup>[202]</sup></a> A jewelled collar fitting tight to
the throat formed, under the name of <em>Peritrachelion</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the principal of these ornaments, of which another
was the <em>Perideraion</em>.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c012'><sup>[203]</sup></a> The <em>Hypoderaion</em> was as its
name imports a necklace that hung low on the
bosom, and the same was the case with the <em>Hormos</em>.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c012'><sup>[204]</sup></a>
On the <em>Tantheuristos Hormos</em> little information can
be obtained, for which reason the commentators
would alter the text; but the most probable conjecture
is, that it obtained its appellation from the
flashing and glancing of the jewels depending from
it upon the breast.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c012'><sup>[205]</sup></a> The <em>Triopis</em> was a species of
necklace distinguished for having three stars or eye-like
gems depending from it as drops. This being
the most fashionable necklace was known under a
variety of names, as the <em>Kathema</em>, and <em>Katheter</em>, and
<em>Mannos</em> or <em>Monnos</em>, among the Dorians.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c012'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of armlets and bracelets there was likewise a
great variety. Some worn above the elbow were
denominated <em>Brachionia</em>, others called <em>Pericarpia</em>, or
<em>Echinoi</em> encircled the wrists and were often in the
form of twisted snakes of gold, which the woman-hater
in Lucian would have converted into real serpents.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c012'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
The <em>Psellia</em> or chain bracelets were much
worn; the <em>Clidones</em> adorned the rich and luxurious
only. As stockings were not in common use, and
shoes and sandals frequently dispensed with when
within doors, fashion required that the feet and
ankles should not remain unadorned. Ancient
writers, accordingly, enumerate several kinds of
anklets, or bangles, all of gold, and varying only
in form, the distinction between which I have been
unable to discover. The <em><a id='corr63.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Ægle'>Ægle,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_63.31'><ins class='correction' title='Ægle'>Ægle,</ins></a></span></em> the <em>Pede</em> and the
<em>Periscelides</em> were so many ornaments for the instep
or ankle.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c012'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Among the ornaments for the bosom we find the
<em>Ægis</em>, evidently like the ægis of Athena, a sort of
rich covering with two hemispherical caps to receive
the breasts, such as we find worn by the
Bayadères of the Dekkan. Extending from this
on either side, or passing over its lower edge was
the <em>Maschalister</em>, a broad belt which covered the
armpits, though in Herodotus the word merely signifies
a sword-belt.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c012'><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Like all other delicate and luxurious women, the
Grecian ladies displayed upon their fingers a profusion
of rings, of which some were set with signets, others
with jewels remarkable for their colour and brilliance.
To each of these their copious language supplied a
distinct name.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c012'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Other female ornaments are spoken
of by the comic poets; but in their descriptions it is
difficult to distinguish satire from information. Among
these were the <em>Leroi</em>, golden drops attached to the
tunic; the <em>Ochthoiboi</em>, which seem to have been a
sort of rich tassels; the <em>Helleboroi</em>, ornaments shaped
perhaps like the leaves or flowers of that plant; and
the <em>Pompholuges</em>, which, though left unexplained by
the commentators, probably signified a large clear
kind of bead, as the word originally meant a “water-bubble,”
which a transparent bead resembles.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c012'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Athenian ladies, likewise, displayed their taste
for luxury and splendour in their shoes and sandals.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c012'><sup>[212]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Like our own fashionable dames, they seldom contented
themselves with articles of home manufacture,
but imported whatever was considered most elegant
or tasteful from the neighbouring countries. Sometimes,
perhaps, the fashion only and the name were
imported, as in the case of the Persian half-boot,
fitting tight to the ankle.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c012'><sup>[213]</sup></a> The same thing may
probably be said of the Sicyonian slipper. But there
was an elegant sandal, ornamented with gold, which,
down to a very late period, continued to be imported
from Patara, in <a id='corr65.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Lycia,'>Lycia.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_65.11'><ins class='correction' title='Lycia,'>Lycia.</ins></a></span><a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c012'><sup>[214]</sup></a> Snow-white slippers of fine
linen, flowered with needlework, were occasionally
worn; and from many ancient statues it would seem,
that something very like stockings had been already
introduced. Short women, desirous of adding, if not
a cubit, at least a few inches to their stature, adopted
the use of <em>baukides</em> with high cork heels, and soles of
great thickness.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c012'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>An Athenian beauty usually spent the whole morning
in the important business of the toilette.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c012'><sup>[216]</sup></a> The
crowd of maids who attended on these occasions appears
to have exceeded in number the assistants at
similar rites in a modern dressing-room, the principle
of the division of labour having been pushed to its
greatest extent. Like Hera, who was said by mythologists
to renew her virgin charms as often as she
bathed in the fountain of Canathos,<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c012'><sup>[217]</sup></a> the Attic lady
appeared to undergo diurnal rejuvenescence under the
hands of her maids.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c012'><sup>[218]</sup></a> Her lovely face grew tenfold
more lovely by their arts. Clustering in interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>groups around her, some held the silver basin and
ewer, others the boxes of tooth-powder, or black
paint for the eyebrows, the rouge pots or the blanching
varnish, the essence-bottles or the powder for
the head, the jewel-cases or the mirrors.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c012'><sup>[219]</sup></a> But on
nothing was so much care bestowed as on the hair.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c012'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
Auburn, the colour of Aphrodite’s tresses<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c012'><sup>[221]</sup></a> in Homer,
being considered most beautiful,<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c012'><sup>[222]</sup></a> drugs were invented
in which the hair being dipped, and exposed
to the noon-day sun, it acquired the coveted hue,
and fell in golden curls over their shoulders.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c012'><sup>[223]</sup></a> Others,
contented with their own black hair, exhausted their
ingenuity in augmenting its rich gloss, steeping it in
oils and essences, till all the fragrance of Arabia
seemed to breathe around them. Those waving ringlets
which we admire in their sculpture were often
the creation of art, being produced by curling-irons
heated in ashes;<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c012'><sup>[224]</sup></a> after which, by the aid of jewelled
fillets and golden pins, they were brought forward
over the smooth white forehead,<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c012'><sup>[225]</sup></a> which they sometimes
shaded to the eyebrows, leaving a small ivory
space in the centre, while behind they floated in
shining profusion down the back. When decked in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>this manner, and dressed for the harem<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c012'><sup>[226]</sup></a> in their light
flowered sandals and semi-transparent robes already
described, they were scarcely farther removed from
the state of nature than the Spartan maids themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Contrary to the fashion prevalent in modern times
the bosom, however, was always closely covered, because
being extremely full shaped it began very early
to lose its firmness and beauty.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c012'><sup>[227]</sup></a> Earrings, set with
Red-Sea pearls of great price, depended from their
ears, and an orbicular crown studded with Indian
jewels surmounted and contrasted strikingly with their
dark locks. Add to these the jewelled throat bands,
and costly and glittering necklaces. Their cheeks
though sometimes pale by nature, blushed with rouge,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c012'><sup>[228]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and they even possessed the art to superinduce over
this artificial complexion that peach-like purple
bloom which belongs to the very earliest, dewiest
dawn of beauty. To the tint of the rose they
could likewise add that of the lily. White paint
was in common use,<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c012'><sup>[229]</sup></a> not merely among unmarried
women, and ladies of equivocal reputation, but with
matrons the chastest and most prudent in Athens,
for we find that pattern of an Attic gentlewoman,
the wife of Ischomachos, practising after marriage
every delusive art of the toilette.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c012'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It by no means follows that all this attention<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c012'><sup>[231]</sup></a>
to dress had any other object than to please their
husbands; for the Turkish Sultanas who pass their
lives in the most rigid seclusion are no less sumptuous
in their apparel; but we know that at Athens,
as in London, much of this care was designed to
excite admiration out of doors. For it is highly
erroneous to transfer to Athens the ideas of female
seclusion acquired from travellers in the East, where
no such rigid seclusion was ever known. Husbands,
indeed, who had cause, or supposed they had, to be
jealous, might be put on the rack by beholding the
crowds of admirers who flocked around their wives
the moment they issued into the streets. But there
was no remedy. The laws and customs of the country
often forced the women abroad to assist at processions
and perform their devotions at the shrines
of various goddesses.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c012'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The dress of men included many of the garments
worn by women; for example, the chiton of which
there were several kinds, some with and some without
sleeves. Among the latter was the <em>Exomis</em>,<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c012'><sup>[233]</sup></a>
a short tunic worn by aged men and slaves, but
the name was sometimes applied to a garment
thrown loosely round the body, and to the chiton
with one sleeve.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c012'><sup>[234]</sup></a> Over this in Homeric times was
worn as a defence against the cold, the <em>Chlaina</em><a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c012'><sup>[235]</sup></a> a
cloak strongly resembling a highlander’s tartan, or
the burnoose of the Bedouin Arab. It was, in fact,
a square piece of cloth, occasionally with the corners
rounded off, which, passing over the left shoulder, and
under the right arm, was again thrown over the left
shoulder, leaving the spear arm free.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c012'><sup>[236]</sup></a> This is what
the poet means where he terms the <em>Chlaina</em> double.
It was wrapped twice round the breast, and fastened
over the left shoulder by a brooch.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c012'><sup>[237]</sup></a> Even
this, however, was not deemed sufficient in very
cold weather, and a cloak of skins sown together
with thongs was wrapped about the body as a defence
against the rain or snow. Some persons appear
to have worn skin-cloaks all the year round,
for we find Anaxagoras, in the midst of summer at
Olympia, putting on his when he foresaw there
would be rain.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c012'><sup>[238]</sup></a> Rustics also appear to have considered
a tunic and skin-cloak necessary to complete
their costume.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c012'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The Dorian style of dress formed the point of
transition from the simple elegance of the Homeric
period to the elaborate splendour of the historic age
at Athens. In this mode of clothing, a modern
author remarks, a peculiar taste was displayed, an
antique simplicity “equally removed from the splendour
of Asiatics, and the uncleanliness of barbarians.”<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c012'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
They preserved the use of the Homeric
chiton, or woollen shirt, and over this wore also
the <em>Chlaina</em> or <em>Himation</em>, in the manner described
above. To these was added the <em>Chlamys</em>, which, as
the Spartan laws prohibited dyeing, was universally
white, and denominated <em>Hololeukos</em>.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c012'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was of Thessalian or Macedonian origin, of an
oblong form, the points meeting on the right shoulder,
where they were fastened with a clasp. This
garment was not in use in the heroic ages, and the
earliest mention of it occurs in Sappho;<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c012'><sup>[242]</sup></a> but when
once introduced, it quickly grew fashionable, at first
among the young men, afterwards as a military
cloak. At Athens it was regarded as a mark of
effeminacy, and was fastened with a gold or jewelled
brooch on the breast.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c012'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The men of Sparta, though less thinly clad than
the women, still went abroad very scantily covered.
Their <em>Tribon</em>, a variety of the himation,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c012'><sup>[244]</sup></a> like the
cloak of the poor Spanish gentleman, was clipped
so close that it would barely enclose their persons,
like a case, but was thick and heavy, and calculated
to last. Accordingly, the youth were allowed only
one of these per annum, so that, in warm weather, it
is probable that, with an eye to saving it for winter,
they exchanged it for that more lasting coat with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>which nature had furnished them.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c012'><sup>[245]</sup></a> In the towns,
however, and as often as they thought proper to put
on the appearance of extreme modesty, the young
Spartans drew close their cloaks around them so
as to conceal their hands,<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c012'><sup>[246]</sup></a> the exhibiting of which
has always been regarded as a mark of vulgarity.
Hence the use of gloves, and the affectation of soft
white hands in modern times. The same notions
prevail even among the Turks, who, like Laertes in
Homer, wear long sleeves to their pelisses for the
purpose of defending the hand, to have which white
and well-shaped is among them a mark of noble
blood.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Spartans had the good taste to suffer their
beards and hair to grow long, and were at much
pains to render them glossy and shining. Even in
the field, contrary to the practice at Athens, they
preserved this natural ornament of their heads, and
we find them busy in combing and putting it in
order on the very eve of battle.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c012'><sup>[247]</sup></a> It was usually
parted at the top, and was, in fact, the most becoming
covering imaginable. But they set little
value on cleanliness, and bathed and perfumed themselves
seldom, being evidently of opinion,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c012'><sup>[248]</sup></a> that a
brave man ought not to be too spruce. However,
having no object to gain by aping the exterior of
mendicants, they eschewed the wearing of ragged
cloaks, which, indeed, was forbidden by law.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Athenians ran into the opposite <a id='corr71.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='extreme,'>extreme.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_71.29'><ins class='correction' title='extreme,'>extreme.</ins></a></span>
Wealthy, and fond of show, they delighted in a
style of dress in the highest degree curious and
magnificent, appearing abroad in flowing robes of
the finest linen, dyed with purple and other brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>colours.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c012'><sup>[249]</sup></a> Beneath these they wore tunics of
various kinds, which, though the fashion afterwards
changed, were at first sleeveless, since we find the
women, in Aristophanes, suffering the hair to grow
under their arm-pits to avoid being discovered when,
disguised as their husbands, they should hold up
their hands to vote in the assembly.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c012'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Like the women, they affected much variety and
splendour in their rings, which were sometimes set
with a stone with the portrait engraved thereon of
some friend or benefactor, as Athenion wore on one
of his the portrait of Mithridates.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c012'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In his girdle and shoes,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c012'><sup>[252]</sup></a> too, the Athenian betrayed
his love of splendour. The hair worn long
like that of the ladies,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c012'><sup>[253]</sup></a> was curled or braided and
built up in glossy masses on the crown of the head,
or arranged artfully along the forehead by golden
grasshoppers.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c012'><sup>[254]</sup></a> But as all this pile of ringlets could
not be thrust into the helmet, it was customary in
time of war to cut the hair short, which the fashionable
young men reckoned among its most serious
hardships. Hats<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c012'><sup>[255]</sup></a> were not habitually worn, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>on journeys or promenades undertaken during hot
weather they formed a necessary part of the costume.
Above all things the Athenian citizen affected
extreme cleanliness and neatness in his person,
and the same taste descended even to the slaves who
in the streets could scarcely be distinguished by dress,
hair, or ornaments, from their masters.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c012'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Even the philosophers, after holding out a long
time, yielded to the influence of fashion, and, lest
their profession should suffer, became exquisites in
its defence. Your truly wise man, says an unexceptionable
witness in a matter of this kind, has his
hair closely shaved, (this was an eastern innovation,)
but suffers his magnificent beard to fall in wavy
curls over his breast. His shoes, fitting tight as
wax, are supported by a net-work of thongs, disposed
at equal distances up the small of the leg.
A chlamys puffed out effeminately at the breast conceals
his figure, and like a foreigner he leans contemplatively
upon his staff.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c012'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the art of dress appears to have received its
greatest improvements in Ionia, where, according to
Democritos, the Ephesian, both the garments, at one
time in fashion, and the stuffs of which they consisted,
were varied with a skill and fertility of invention
worthy of a polished people. Some persons,
he says, appeared in robes of a violet, others of a
purple, others of a saffron colour, sprinkled with
dusky lozenges. As at Athens, much attention was
bestowed on the hair, which they adorned with small
ornamental figures. Their vests were yellow, like
a ripe quince, or purple, or crimson, or pure white.
Even their tunics, imported from Corinth, were of
the finest texture, and of the richest dyes, hyacinthine
or violet, flame-coloured or deep sea-green.
Others adopted the Persian <em>calasiris</em>,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c012'><sup>[258]</sup></a> of all tunics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the most superb, and there were those among the
opulent who even affected the Persian <em>actœa</em>, a shawl-mantle
of the costliest and most gorgeous appearance.
It was formed of a close-woven, but light
stuff, bedropped with golden beads in the form of
millet-seed, which were connected with the tissue
by slender eyes passing through the stuff and fastened
by a purple thread.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c012'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Duris, on the authority of the poet Asios, draws
a scarcely less extravagant picture of the luxury
and magnificence of the Samians, who, on certain
festivals, appeared in public adorned, like women,
with glittering bracelets, their hair floating on their
shoulders, skilfully braided into tresses. The words
of Asios preserved in the Deipnosophist are as follow:
“Thus proceed they to the fane of Hera,
clothed in magnificent robes, with snowy pelisses,
trailing behind them on the ground. Glistening
ornaments of gold, like grasshoppers, surmount the
crown of their heads, while their luxuriant tresses
float behind in the wind, intermingled with golden
chains. Bracelets of variegated workmanship adorn
their arms, as the warrior is adorned by his shield
thongs.”<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c012'><sup>[260]</sup></a> This excess of effeminate luxury, attended
as everywhere else by enervating vices, terminated
in the ruin of Samos. Similar manners in
the Colophonians drew upon them a similar fate,
and so in every other Grecian community; for men
never learn wisdom by the example of others, but
hurry on in the career of indulgence as if in the
hope that Providence might overlook them, or set
aside, in their favour, its eternal laws.</p>

1. 13.-3. 67. In Homer, Iliad,
γ. 385, &amp;c. the word, ἑανὸς, signifying
a richly-wrought vest or
robe, is synonymous, as Pollux remarks,
with πέπλος vii. 51. This
is, likewise, the opinion of Buttmann,
who, however, supposes
it to mean a “flexibly soft garment.”—Lexil.
Art. 41. Others
draw a distinction between ἑανὸς
and πέπλος, the former, they say,
being employed to signify a veil
unwrought and purely white, the
latter, one which was variegated
with colours and embroidery.
Passow considers it to be a mere
adjective signifying “clear, light,”
and says, that εἷμα or ἱμάτιον is
always understood with it.</p>

presides over the in-door dress of
the modern Greek women. “In
the gynecæum,” says Chandler,
“the girl, like Thetis, treading on
a soft carpet, has her white and
delicate feet naked; the nails
tinged with red. Her trowsers,
which in winter are of red cloth,
and in summer of fine calico or
thin gauze, descend from the hip
to the ankle, hanging loosely
about her limbs, the lower portion
embroidered with flowers,
and appearing beneath the shift,
which has the sleeves wide and
open, and the seams and edges
curiously adorned with needlework.
Her vest is of silk, exactly
fitted to the form of the
bosom and the shape of the
body, which it rather covers
than conceals, and is shorter
than the shift. The sleeves
button occasionally to the hand,
and are lined with red or yellow
satin. A rich zone encompasses
her waist, and is fastened
before by clasps of silver
gilded, or of gold, set with precious
stones. Over the vest is
a robe, in summer lined with
ermine, and in cold weather
with fur. The head-dress is a
skull-cap, red or green, with
pearls; a stay under the chin,
and a yellow fore-head cloth,
She has bracelets of gold on
her wrists; and, like Aurora,
is rosy-fingered, the tips being
stained. Her necklace is a
string of zechins, a species of
gold coin, or of the pieces called
Byzantines. At her cheeks is
a lock of hair made to curl toward
the face; and down her
back falls a profusion of tresses,
spreading over her shoulders.”—ii.

</div>

<h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER I. <br /> PRIVATE DWELLINGS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The opinion appears to prevail among certain
writers, that the private dwellings of the Hellenes,
or at least of the Athenians, were always mean and
insignificant.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c012'><sup>[261]</sup></a> This imaginary fact they account for
by supposing, that nobles and opulent citizens were
deterred from indulging in the luxuries of architecture
by the form of government and the envious
jealousy of the common people. But such a view of
the matter is inconsistent with the testimony of history.
At Athens, as everywhere else, things followed
their natural course. In the early ages of the commonwealth,
when manners were simple, the houses
of the greatest men in the state differed very little
from those of their neighbours. As wealth, however,
and luxury increased, together with the developement
of the democratic principle, individuals erected themselves
mansions vying in extent and splendour with
the public edifices of the state;<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c012'><sup>[262]</sup></a> and as the polity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>degenerated more and more into ochlocracy, the dwellings
of the rich<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c012'><sup>[263]</sup></a> increased in size and grandeur, until
they at length outstripped the very temples of the
gods. A similar process took place at Sparta, where
shortly after the Peloponnesian war, the more distinguished
citizens possessed suburban villas, which
seem to have been of spacious dimensions and filled
with costly furniture.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c012'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Upon these points, however, I dwell, not from any
belief that they are honourable to the Greek character,
but because they are true. It would have
been more satisfactory to find them preserving, in
every period of their history, the stern and lofty
simplicity of republican manners, far outshining in
the eyes of the philosopher the palaces of Oriental
kings glittering with gold and ivory and jewels, insomuch
that the cottage of Socrates, erected in the
humblest style of Athenian domestic architecture,
would be an object, were it still in existence, of
far deeper interest to the genuine lover of antiquity
than the mansions of Meidias or Callias, or even
than the imperial abodes of Semiramis, Darius, and
Artaxerxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, wherever there exists opulence, it
will exhibit itself in the erection of stately dwellings;
and accordingly we find that, prior even to
the Trojan war,<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c012'><sup>[265]</sup></a> commerce and increasing luxury had
already inspired the Greeks with a taste for splendour
and magnificence, which displayed itself especially
in the architecture and ornaments of their
palaces and houses of the great.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c012'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Homer, minute and graphic in his descriptions,
delineates a very flattering picture of Greek domestic
architecture in his time, when the chiefs
and nobles had already begun to enshrine themselves
in spacious edifices, elaborately ornamented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>with, and surrounded by, all the circumstances of
pomp known to their age.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c012'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In those days the greatest men did not disdain
to apply themselves to agriculture, to have their
dwellings surrounded by the signs and implements
of the pursuit in which they were engaged.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c012'><sup>[268]</sup></a> And
as in southern Italy the ancient nobles erected shops
in front of their palaces or villas, in which the produce
of their land was disposed of, so in the Homeric
houses the same space was occupied by the
farm-yard enclosed by strong and lofty walls, surrounded
by battlements, within which were their
heaps of manure, harrows, ploughs, carts, and waggons,
and stacks of hay and corn;<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c012'><sup>[269]</sup></a> and hither, too,
in the evening were driven in their numerous flocks
and herds, to protect them from the nightly marauders.
The great entrance gates were in the heroic
ages guarded by ban dogs,<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c012'><sup>[270]</sup></a> which afterwards made
way for porters,<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c012'><sup>[271]</sup></a> and in still later times were succeeded
by eunuchs.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c012'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Occasionally for the canine doorkeepers were substituted
in commercial states gold and silver representations,
more likely to attract than repel thieves;
for example, at the entrance to Alcinoös’s palace
were groups of this description, attributed to the
wonder-working Hephæstos.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c012'><sup>[273]</sup></a> A coarse imitation of
this practice prevailed among the Romans, for we find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>in Petronius that Trimalchio had his court guarded
by a painted mastiff, over which in good square characters
were the words “Beware of the dog.”<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c012'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Along the walls of this enclosure the cattle-sheds
would in remoter ages appear to have been ranged,
where afterwards stood suites of chambers for the
domestics, or piazzas, or colonades, to serve as covered
walks in extremely hot or bad weather. Within,
on either side the gateway,<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c012'><sup>[275]</sup></a> chiefly among the Dorians,
rose a pillar of conical shape, sometimes an
obelisk, in honour of Apollo or of Dionysos, or,
according to others, of both, while in the centre
was an altar of Zeus Herceios, on which family sacrifices
were offered up.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c012'><sup>[276]</sup></a> At its inner extremity
you beheld a spacious portico, adjoining the entrance
to the house, where in warm weather the young men
often slept. From the descriptions of the poet, however,
it would appear to have been something more
than a common portico, resembling rather the porches
of our old English houses, roofed over and extending
like a recess into the body of the house itself.
In the dwellings of the great, this part of the
building, adorned with numerous statues, was probably
of marble finely polished if not sculptured,
and being merely a chamber open in front could
not in those fine climates be by any means an unpleasant
bedroom, particularly as it usually faced
the south and caught the early rays of the sun.
Here Odysseus<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c012'><sup>[277]</sup></a> slept during his stay with Alcinoös,
as did likewise Priam and the Trojan Herald while
guests of Achilles in his military hut.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c012'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In this porch were seats of handsome polished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>stone, as in the palace of Nestor at Pylos, which,
to render them more shining, would appear to have
been rubbed with oil.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c012'><sup>[279]</sup></a> Similar seats are found to
this day before the houses of the wealthy at Cairo
and other cities of the East, where in the cool of
the evening old men habitually take their station,
and are joined for the purpose of gossip by their
neighbours. In the larger towns of Nubia an open
space planted with dates, palms, or the Egyptian
fig-tree, more shady and spreading than the oak,
and furnished with wooden seats, collects together
the elders, who there enjoy what the Englishman
seeks in his club, and the Greek found in his lesche—the
pleasure of comparing his opinions with those
of his neighbours.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, in after times, this plain porch had been
succeeded by a magnificent peristyle or colonnade,
the primitive custom of sleeping in the open air was
abandoned; but here the master of the house with
his guests took their early walk to enjoy the morning
sun. It was customary among all ranks at Athens
to rise betimes, as it generally is still in the warm
countries of the South. Socrates and his young
friend, the sophist-hunter,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c012'><sup>[280]</sup></a> coming to the house of
Callias, soon after day-break, find its owner taking
the air with several of his guests in the colonnade,
the young men moving in the train of their elders,
and making way for them as they turn round to retrace
their steps. There was usually at Athens a
similar peristyle on both sides of the house—one
for summer the other for winter, and a door generally
opened from the women’s apartment into that
communicating with the garden, where the ladies
enjoyed the cool air in the midst of laurel copses,
fountains, and patches of green sward,<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c012'><sup>[281]</sup></a> interspersed
with rose-trees, violet-beds, and other sweet shrubs
and flowers.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The town-houses of Homeric times had generally
no aulè, but the porch opened directly into the street,
since it is here that, in the description of the shield,
we find the women standing to behold the dancers
and enjoy the music of the nuptial procession.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c012'><sup>[282]</sup></a> Afterwards,
as the taste for magnificence advanced, the
whole façade of the corps de logis<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c012'><sup>[283]</sup></a> was richly ornamented,
while the outer gates were purposely left
open, that the passers-by might witness the splendour
of the owner. Occasionally, likewise, the great
door, leading from the portico into the house, was
concealed by costly purple hangings,<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c012'><sup>[284]</sup></a> which, being
passed, you entered a broad passage, having on either
side, doors<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c012'><sup>[285]</sup></a> leading into the apartments on the ground
floor, and conducting to an inner court, surrounded
by a peristyle, where the gynæconitis,<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c012'><sup>[286]</sup></a> or harem, commenced.</p>

<p class='c001'>The apartments of palaces displayed, even in very
early times, the taste of the Greeks for splendour
and magnificence. The walls were covered with
wainscoting inlaid with gold and ivory, as we still
find in the East whole chambers lined with mother-of-pearl.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c012'><sup>[287]</sup></a>
At first, the gold was laid on in thin plates,
which, in process of time, led to the idea of gilding.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c012'><sup>[288]</sup></a>
Even Phocion, who affected great simplicity and
plainness, had the walls of his house adorned with
laminæ of copper,<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c012'><sup>[289]</sup></a> probably in the same style as that
subterraneous chamber discovered, during the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>century, in the excavations made at Rome. It appears,
too, that, occasionally, the walls of the apartments
at Athens, as at Herculaneum and Pompeii
were decorated with paintings in bright colours,<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c012'><sup>[290]</sup></a>
probably in the same style, though as much superior
in beauty and delicacy of execution, as art, in
the age of Pericles, was superior to art in the days
of Nero. Still the paintings discovered in the excavated
Italian cities,—sometimes<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c012'><sup>[291]</sup></a> grotesque and extravagant,
as where we behold the pigmies making
war upon the cranes, winged geniuses at work in a
carpenter’s or shoemaker’s shop, or an ass laden with
hampers of wine, rushing forward to engage a crocodile,
whilst his master pulls him back by the tail—sometimes
rural and elegant, consisting of a series
of wild landscapes, mountains dotted with cottages,
sea-shores, harbours, and baths, Nymphs and Cupids
angling on the borders of lakes, beneath trees of the
softest and most exquisite foliage,—may enable us
to form some conception of the landscapes with
which Agelarcos<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c012'><sup>[292]</sup></a> adorned the house of Alcibiades.</p>

<p class='c001'>The halls and saloons on the ground-floor were
paved with marble or mosaic work,<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c012'><sup>[293]</sup></a> which often, if
we may judge from the specimens left us by their
imitators, represented pictures of the greatest elegance,
containing, among other things, likenesses of
the loveliest divinities of Olympos.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c012'><sup>[294]</sup></a> These mosaics
were wrought with minute shards of precious marbles
of various colours, interspersed with pieces of
amber,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c012'><sup>[295]</sup></a> and, probably, also, of glass, as was the
fashion in Italy, where whole hyaline floors have
been found consisting either of one piece or of
squares so finely joined together, that the sutures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>were invisible to the naked eye. No mention, I believe,
is made in Greek authors of lining the walls
of apartments with glass, or even of glass windows,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c012'><sup>[296]</sup></a>
which, however, were common in the cities of Magna
Græcia in the age immediately succeeding that of
our Saviour. It is extremely probable, however,
that as the Greeks were as well acquainted as the
Romans with the properties of the lapis specularis;<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c012'><sup>[297]</sup></a>
they likewise made use of thin plates of this stone,
or talc, or gypsum, as they still do in Egypt for
window-panes. So much, indeed, seems inferable
from a passage of Plutarch,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c012'><sup>[298]</sup></a> as, also, that transparent
squares of horn were employed for the same
purpose, as oyster-shells and oiled paper still are
in China. Previously, however, the windows<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c012'><sup>[299]</sup></a> (sometimes
square and situated high in the wall, sometimes
reaching from the ceiling to the floor) were
closed with lattice-work<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c012'><sup>[300]</sup></a> in iron, bronze, or wood,
over which, in bad weather, blinds of hair-cloth or
prepared leather were usually drawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ceilings at first consisted merely of the beams,
rafters, and planks, forming the roof, and supporting
the layers of earth or straw that covered it; but, by
degrees, the wood-work was carefully painted, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>arranged so as to form a succession of coffers and
deep sunken panels. Sometimes the whole ceiling
consisted of chamfered, or fretted cedar work,<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c012'><sup>[301]</sup></a> or
of cypress wood, or was covered with paintings in
blue and gold, and supported on columns<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c012'><sup>[302]</sup></a> lofty and
deeply fluted for the purpose, as has been ingeniously
conjectured,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c012'><sup>[303]</sup></a> of receiving spears into the semi-cylindrical
cavities thus formed. If this idea be well
founded, we have a very satisfactory reason of the
origin of fluting columns, and it appears to be perfectly
consistent with Homer’s account of Odysseus’s
chamber, where a number of lances are spoken of
standing round a pillar.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c012'><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The principal apartments, according to the fashion
still prevailing in the East, were furnished with
divans,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c012'><sup>[305]</sup></a> or broad immovable seats, running along the
walls, which are now stuffed soft atop with cotton,
and covered with scarlet or purple, bordered by gold
fringe a foot deep. In the Homeric age they would
appear to have been of carved wood, inlaid with
ivory and gold, and studded with silver nails.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c012'><sup>[306]</sup></a> For
these divans they had a variety of coverings, sometimes
skins, at others purple carpets, in addition to
which they, as now, piled up, as a rest for the back
or elbow, heaps of cushions, purple above, and of
white linen beneath.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c012'><sup>[307]</sup></a> By degrees, these seats became
movable and were converted into couches or
sofas, manufactured of bronze, or silver, or precious
woods, veneered with tortoiseshell.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c012'><sup>[308]</sup></a> In the palaces
of oriental sultans they are sometimes made of
alabaster, encrusted with jewels. Somewhere in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>more retired parts of the Domos were the picture-gallery
and library, of neither of which have we any
exact description. The former, however, faced the
north, and the latter the west. If the libraries of
the Greeks at all resembled in form and dimensions
those found at Pompeii, they were by no means
spacious; neither, in fact, was a great deal of room
necessary, as the manuscripts of the ancients stowed
away much closer than our modern books,<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c012'><sup>[309]</sup></a> and were
sometimes kept in circular boxes, of elegant form,
with covers of turned wood. The volumes consisted
of rolls of parchment, sometimes purple at the back,<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c012'><sup>[310]</sup></a>
or papyrus, about twelve or fourteen inches in breadth,
and as many feet long as the subject required.
The pages formed a number of transverse compartments,
commencing at the left, and proceeding in
order to the other extremity, and the reader, holding
in either hand one end of the manuscript, unrolled
and rolled it up<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c012'><sup>[311]</sup></a> as he read. Occasionally
these books were placed on shelves, in piles, with
the ends outwards, adorned with golden bosses,<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c012'><sup>[312]</sup></a> the
titles of the various treatises being written on pendant
labels.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we proceed now to the court<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c012'><sup>[313]</sup></a> dividing the Domos
from the Thalamos we shall perceive, on both sides
of the door leading out of the Andron, flights of
steps ascending to the upper chambers where, in
the heroic ages, the young men and strangers of
distinction usually slept. Thus, in the palace of
Ithaca, Telemachos had a bed-chamber on the second
story, whence the poet is careful to observe he enjoyed
a good prospect.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c012'><sup>[314]</sup></a> In later times, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>there were, on the ground floor, suites of apartments,
denominated Xenon, appropriated to the use of guests,
who there lived freely and at ease as in their own
houses.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the further extremity of the interior court a
steep flight of steps led to an elevated basement and
doorway, which formed the entrance into the thalamos.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c012'><sup>[315]</sup></a>
This part of the house would appear to
have been laid out in a peculiar manner, consisting,
first, of a lofty and spacious apartment,<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c012'><sup>[316]</sup></a> where all
the females of the family usually sat while engaged
in embroidery or other needlework.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c012'><sup>[317]</sup></a> It likewise
formed the nursery, and, at its inner extremity, in a
deep recess, the bed of the mistress of the family
appears to have stood, on either side of which were
doors leading to flights of steps into the garden,
set apart for the use of the women.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has by many been supposed, that the Thalamos
was a chamber particularly appropriated to the use
of young unmarried ladies; but, since we find Helen
and Penelope inhabiting the Thalamos, it may be presumed
that it was common to all the females of the
house. Hector, in his visit to Paris, finds him in the
Thalamos, turning about and polishing his arms, as
if he meant to use them, while, close at hand, are
Helen and her maids engaged in weaving or embroidery.
The word was often used in the same
signification as Gynæconitis,<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c012'><sup>[318]</sup></a> or “the harem;” and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>therefore, when Theocritus<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c012'><sup>[319]</sup></a> speaks of a “maiden
from the Thalamus,” and Phocylides, with the suspicious
caution of a more vicious age, advises that young
women be kept in “well-locked Thalamoi,” it is clear
that the female apartments generally are meant.
These were, in Sparta, called οα̈ (which, as is well
known, in the common language of Greece, <a id='corr86.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='signinifies'>signifies</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_86.7'><ins class='correction' title='signinifies'>signifies</ins></a></span>
eggs), whence, according to Clearchos,<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c012'><sup>[320]</sup></a> the
fable which describes Helen proceeding from an egg,
because born and educated in the chambers so called.
Throughout the Iliad and the Odyssey we find the
poet speaking of this part of the house as inhabited
by women. Here lived Penelope,<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c012'><sup>[321]</sup></a> far from the
brawls of the suitors who crowded the halls of the
Domos; and here Ares pressed his suit with success
to Astyoche and Polymela, who both became the
mothers of valiant sons.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c012'><sup>[322]</sup></a> From which, among many
other circumstances, it is manifest that, in those
ages, the sexes met easily, even the entrance to the
harem not being impracticable to a lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bedchambers of the young unmarried women
appear to have flanked the great central hall of the
Thalamos, and here the female slaves likewise slept,
apparently in recesses, near the chamber-doors of
their mistresses, as we find particularly remarked
in the case of Nausicaa and her maids. At Athens,
the door of communication between the Andron<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c012'><sup>[323]</sup></a> and
the Gynæconitis was kept carefully barred and locked
to prevent all intercourse between the male and
female slaves, the keys being entrusted solely to
the mistress of the house.</p>

<p class='c001'>As these apartments were less exposed than any
other portion of the building, and far more carefully
guarded, it became customary, as in the East
it still is, to lay up in the Thalamos, more especially
in the dark basement story, much valuable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>property, such as arms, gold, silver, the wardrobe
of both sexes, and even oil and wine. Among the
Romans, or, indeed, among the Greeks, of a later
age,<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c012'><sup>[324]</sup></a> this step would scarcely have been taken, lest
the ladies should have grown too assiduous in their
attention to the skins. But in remoter ages these
sordid fears had no existence. Accordingly, we find
the prudent Odysseus, who apprehended, perhaps,
the tricks of his domestics, stowing away his casks
of choice old wine in the Thalamos, doubtless, considering
it safer there, under the keeping of Euryclea,
than it would have been anywhere else in the
palace.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c012'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In later and more civilized ages, the Thalamos
was still used for the same purposes; for, in the
establishment of Ischomachos, a pattern of Attic
economy, we find that the more valuable portion of
the family wardrobe, with the plate and other costly
utensils, was there deposited. Corn, according to the
suggestions of common sense, they laid up in the
driest rooms, wine in the coolest. The apartments
into which most sunshine found its way were appropriated
to such employments and to the display
of such furniture as required much light.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c012'><sup>[326]</sup></a> Their
dining-rooms, where, also, the men usually sat when
at home, they carefully contrived so as to be cool
in summer and warm in winter, though, in severe
weather, a good fire was often found necessary.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c012'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
The same judicious principle commonly regulated
the erection of their habitations, which were divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>into two sets of apartments, suited to the two great
divisions of the year. As we have already remarked,
the principal front looked towards the south, that
it might catch the rays of the wintry sun, whose
more vertical summer beams were excluded by broad
verandahs, or colonnades.</p>

<p class='c001'>In what part of the edifice stood the bathing-room
(βαλανεῖον, so called from its having, in remoter ages,
been heated with acorns, βάλανοι)<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c012'><sup>[328]</sup></a> I have been unable
to discover, though it appears certain that,
even so far back as the heroic ages, a chamber
was always set apart for the bath. At first, doubtless,
they were content with cold water; but that
this was soon succeeded by warm water<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c012'><sup>[329]</sup></a> may be conjectured
from the tradition ascribing the first use
of it to Heracles, whence warm baths were ever
afterwards called the Baths of Heracles.</p>

<p class='c001'>The form of the Puelos,<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c012'><sup>[330]</sup></a> or vessel in which they
bathed, appears occasionally to have resembled an
Egyptian sarcophagus, and to have been sometimes
round, and constructed of white or green marble,
or glass, or bronze, or common stone, or wood,<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c012'><sup>[331]</sup></a> in
which case it would seem to have been portable. In
the baths of Pompeii the marble basins, whether
parallelogramatic or circular, were of spacious dimensions,
and raised two or three feet above the pavement.
A step for the convenience of the bathers
extends round it on the inside, and at the bottom are
marble cushions upon which they rested. In the labra
of the Grecian female baths rose a smooth cippus in
the form of a truncated cone, denominated omphalos,
on which the ladies sat while chatting with their female
companions.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c012'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When once the warm bath came into use, people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>employed it to excess, bathing as frequently as five
or six times a day, and in water so hot as to half
scald themselves.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c012'><sup>[333]</sup></a> Immediately afterwards, to prevent
the skin from chapping, they anointed their
bodies with oils and perfumed unguents.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c012'><sup>[334]</sup></a> Occasionally,
instead of plunging into the water, they sat upright,
as is still the custom in the hammāms of the
East, while the water was poured with a sort of ladle
on their head and shoulders.</p>

<p class='c001'>The public baths, of which no full description referring
to very ancient times remains, were numerous
in all Hellenic cities, more particularly at Athens,
where they were surmounted with domes,<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c012'><sup>[335]</sup></a> and received
their light from above. These establishments
were frequented by all classes of women who could
afford to pay for such luxury, rich, poor, honourable,
and dishonourable.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attendants, in later and more corrupt times
at least, were men, whose sole clothing consisted of
a leathern apron about the loins, while the ladies, who
undressed in the Apodyterion, went through the various
processes of the bath in the same primitive
clothing. It was, however, customary for them to
enter the water together in crowds,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c012'><sup>[336]</sup></a> so that they kept
each other in countenance. Here the matrons who
had sons to marry studied the form and character of
the young ladies who frequented the baths; and as
all the defects both of person and features were necessarily
revealed, it was next to impossible for any lady,
not sufficiently opulent to keep up a bathing establishment
in her own house, to retain for any length of
time an undeserved celebrity for beauty. In the
baths of the East, the bodies of the bathers are
cleansed by small bags of camel-hair, woven rough,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and passed over the hand of the attendant; or with
a handful of the fine fibres of the Mekka palm-tree
combed soft, and filled with fragrant and saponaceous
earths, which are rubbed on the skin till the whole
body is covered with froth. Similar means were
employed in the baths of Greece, and the whole was
afterwards cleansed off the skin by gold or silver stlengides,
or blunt scrapers somewhat curved towards the
point.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c012'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The architectural arrangements of these baths,<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c012'><sup>[338]</sup></a> if
we may draw any analogy from similar establishments
in a later age, were nearly as follows:—Entering
the building by a lofty and spacious portico, you
found yourself in a large hall, paved with marble and
adorned with columns, from which, through a side-door,
you passed into the Apodyterion, or undressing-room;
next, into a chamber where was the cold water
in basins of porphyry or green jasper; immediately
contiguous lay the Tepidarium, to which succeeded
the Sudarium, a vaulted apartment furnished with
basins of warm water, and where the heat was excessive;
from this, moving forward, you successively traversed
saloons of various degrees of temperature and
dimensions, until you found yourself in the dressing-room,
whither your garments had been carried by
your domestic, or the attendants on the baths.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c012'><sup>[339]</sup></a> These
establishments were likewise provided with water-closets,<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c012'><sup>[340]</sup></a>
placed in a retired part of the building, and
furnished with wooden seats, basin and water-pipe, as
in modern times.</p>

<p class='c001'>To diminish the chances of being robbed, stealing
from a bath was at Athens made a capital
offence;<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c012'><sup>[341]</sup></a> so that the persons who frequented them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>ran very little risk. The price was usually moderate,
though in some cities, as for example at Phaselis,
they were in the habit of doubling their
charges to foreigners, which drew from a witty sophist
a very cutting remark; for his slave disputing
with the keeper of the bath, and contending that
his master ought not to be charged more than
other persons, the sophist, who overheard the dispute,
exclaimed, <a id='corr91.10'></a><a href='#c_91.10'><ins class='correction' title='See comment.'>“Wretch</ins></a>, would you make me a
‘Phaselitan for a farthing?’”<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c012'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The roofs of the more ancient Greek houses were
generally flat,<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c012'><sup>[343]</sup></a> not sloping upwards to a point, as
was afterwards the fashion.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c012'><sup>[344]</sup></a> In Egypt and Syria,
and almost throughout the East, the same taste
still obtains; and as palm trees, loftier than the
buildings, often grow beside the walls, and extend
their beautiful pendulous branches over a great part
of the roof, nothing can be more delightful on a
mild serene evening than to sit aloft on those
breezy eminences sipping coffee, gazing over the
green rice fields, or watching the stars as they put
forth their golden lamps through the violet skirts
of day. But there a parapet usually preserves him
who enjoys the scene from falling. It was otherwise
of old in Greece. The roof consisted simply
of a number of beams laid close together and covered
with cement, so that, as was proved by the fate
of Elpenor,<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c012'><sup>[345]</sup></a> the practice of sleeping there in warm
weather, quite common throughout the country, was
not wholly without danger.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the construction of the kitchen,<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c012'><sup>[346]</sup></a> which in
Greek houses was sometimes a separate little building
erected in the court-yard, our information is
extremely imperfect. It is certain, however, contrary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to the common opinion, that it was furnished
with a chimney,<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c012'><sup>[347]</sup></a> and that the smoke was not permitted
to find its way through an aperture in the
roof. Thus much might be inferred from a passage
in the Wasps, when the old dicast, in love
with the courts of law, is endeavouring to escape
from the restraint imposed on him by his son, by
climbing out through the chimney. It is clear that
he has got into some aperture, where he is hidden
from sight, for hearing a noise in the wall, his son
Bdelycleon, cries out, “What is that?” upon which
the old man replies, “I am only the smoke.” It
is plain, that he would not, like a Hindù Yoghi,
be balancing himself in the air, otherwise the young
man must have beheld him sailing up towards the
roof. But the matter is set entirely at rest by the
Scholiast, who observes, that the καπνοδόχη was a
narrow channel like a pipe through which the smoke
ascended from the kitchen. This explanation has
been confirmed by the discoveries of Colonel Leake,<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c012'><sup>[348]</sup></a>
who on the rocky slopes of the hill of the Museion
and Pnyx, found the remains of a house
partly excavated in the rock, in which the chimney
still remained.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same convenience, also, existed in the Roman
kitchens,<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c012'><sup>[349]</sup></a> though they would appear to have been
unskilfully constructed in both countries, since the
cooks complain of the smoke being borne hither
and thither by the wind, and interfering with their
operations. However, this may have arisen from
the numerous small furnaces which, as in France,
were ranged along the wall for the purpose of cooking
several dishes at once. The chimneys having
been perpendicular, as in our old farm-houses, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>furnished with stoppers to keep out the rain in bad
weather.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c012'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>That the kitchens were sometimes not sufficiently
airy and comfortable may be inferred from the practice
of a philosophical cook in Damoxenos, who used
to take his station immediately outside the door, and
from thence give his orders to the inferior operatives.
Great care was nevertheless taken that it
should be well lighted, and that the door should
be so situated as to be as little exposed as possible
to whirling gusts of wind.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c012'><sup>[351]</sup></a> From a passage in the
Scholiast on the Wasps, and the existence of drains
in the excavations on the hill of the Museion, it is
clear that the Athenian houses were furnished with
sinks,<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c012'><sup>[352]</sup></a> though in the Italian kitchens there seem
merely to have been little channels running along
the walls to carry off the water. The floor, too, was
constructed in both countries with a view at once
to dryness and elegance,<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c012'><sup>[353]</sup></a> being formed of several
layers of various materials all porous though binding,
so that it allowed whatever water was spilt to sink
through instantaneously. The upper layer, about
six inches thick, consisted of a cement composed of
lime, sand, and pounded charcoal or ashes, the surface
of which, being polished with pumice-stone,
presented to the eye the appearance of a fine black
marble. The roof in early times was no doubt of
wood,<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c012'><sup>[354]</sup></a> though afterwards it came to be vaulted or
run up in the form of a cupola. The walls were
sometimes decorated with rude paintings.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c012'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The street-door of a Grecian house, usually, when
single, opened outwards, but when there were folding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>doors they opened inwards as with us.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c012'><sup>[356]</sup></a> In the
former case it was customary when any one happened
to be going forth, to knock, or call, or ring
a bell, in order to warn passengers to make way.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c012'><sup>[357]</sup></a>
These doors were constructed of various materials,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c012'><sup>[358]</sup></a>
according to the taste and circumstances of the
owner, sometimes of oak, or fir, or maple, or elm;
and afterwards as luxury advanced they were made
of cedar, cyprus, or even of citron wood, inlaid as
in the East, with plates of brass or gold.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c012'><sup>[359]</sup></a> Mention
is likewise made of doors entirely composed of
the precious metals; of iron also, and bronze and
ivory.</p>

<p class='c001'>The jambs were generally of wood;<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c012'><sup>[360]</sup></a> but likewise
sometimes of brass or marble. The doors were fastened
at first by long bars passing into the wall on both
sides;<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c012'><sup>[361]</sup></a> and by degrees smaller bolts, hasps, latches,
and locks and keys succeeded. For example the
outer door of the Thalamos in Homer was secured
by a silver hasp, and a leathern thong passed round
the handle and tied, perhaps, in a curious knot.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c012'><sup>[362]</sup></a>
Doors were not usually suspended on hinges, but
turned, as they still do in the East, upon pivots
inserted above into the lintel and below into the
threshhold.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c012'><sup>[363]</sup></a> In many houses there were in addition
small half-doors of open wood-work,<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c012'><sup>[364]</sup></a> which
alone were commonly closed by day, in order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>keep the children from running out, or dogs or pigs
from entering. The doors usually consisted of a
frame-work, with four or six sunken panels, as with
us; but at Sparta, so long as the laws of Lycurgus
prevailed, they were made of simple planks fashioned
with the hatchet.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c012'><sup>[365]</sup></a> In the great Dorian capital the
custom was for persons desirous of entering a house
to shout aloud at the door,<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c012'><sup>[366]</sup></a> which, at Athens,<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c012'><sup>[367]</sup></a> was
always furnished with an elegant knocker.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c012'><sup>[368]</sup></a> Door-handles,
too, of costly materials and curious workmanship,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c012'><sup>[369]</sup></a>
bespoke even in that trifling matter the
taste of the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The materials commonly used in the erection of
a house were stones and bricks. In the manufacture
of the latter<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c012'><sup>[370]</sup></a> the ancients exhibited more
skill and care than we; they had bricks of a very
large size, and half bricks for filling up spaces,
which prevented the necessity of shortening them
with the trowel. Of these some were simply dried
in the sun, used chiefly in building the dwellings of
the poor.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c012'><sup>[371]</sup></a> At Utica in Africa there were public
inspectors of brick-kilns,<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c012'><sup>[372]</sup></a> to prevent any from being
used which had not been made five years. In several
cities on the Mediterranean bricks were manufactured
of a porous earth, which when baked and
painted, as it may be conjectured, on the outside,
were so light that they would swim in water.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c012'><sup>[373]</sup></a> To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>diminish the weight of bricks, straw was introduced
into them in Syria and Egypt, which was altogether
consumed in the baking. In roofing such of their
houses as were not terraced they employed slates,
tiles, and reed-thatch.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c012'><sup>[374]</sup></a> Possibly, also, the wealthy
may have tiled their houses with those elegant
thin flakes of marble, with which the roofs of temples
were occasionally covered.</p>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='f261'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r261'>261</a>. But even from a fragment of
Bacchylides we may infer the

among the Merovingian princes
of France: “The mansion of
the long-haired kings was surrounded
with convenient yards
and stables for the cattle and
the poultry; the garden was
planted with useful vegetables;
the various trades, the labours
of agriculture, and even the
arts of hunting and fishing were
exercised by servile hands for
the emolument of the sovereign;
his magazines were filled with
corn and wine, either for sale

by the strictest maxims of private
economy.”—Gibbon, Decline

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER II. <br /> HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The movables in a Grecian house were divided
into classes after a very characteristic manner. First,
as a mark of the national piety, everything used in
domestic sacrifices was set apart. The second division,
placing women immediately after the gods,
comprehended the whole apparatus of female ornaments<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c012'><sup>[375]</sup></a>
worn on solemn festivals. Next were classed
the sacred robes and military uniforms of the men;
then came the hangings, bed-furniture, and ornaments
of the harem; afterwards those of the men’s
apartments. Another division consisted of the shoes,
sandals, slippers, &amp;c., of the family, from which we
pass to the arms and implements of war, mixed up
familiarly in a Greek house with looms, cards, spinning-wheels,
and embroidery-frames, just, as Homer
describes them in the Thalamos of Paris at Troy.
Even yet we have not reached the end of our inventory
in mere classification. The baking, cooking,
washing, and bathing vessels formed a separate
class, and so did the breakfast and dinner services,
the porcelain, the plate of silver and gold, the
mirrors, the candelabra, and all those curious articles
made use of in the toilette of the ladies.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c012'><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In well-regulated families a second division took
place, a separation being made of such articles as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>might be required for daily use, from those brought
forward only when routs and large parties were
given. The movables of all kinds having been
thus arranged in their classes, the next step was
to deposit every thing in its proper place.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c012'><sup>[377]</sup></a> The
more ordinary utensils were generally laid up in a
spacious store-room, called <em>tholos</em>,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c012'><sup>[378]</sup></a> a circular building
detached from the house, and usually terminating
in a pointed roof, whence in after ages a
sharp-crowned hat obtained among the people the
name of Tholos. When a gentleman first commenced
housekeeping, or got a new set of domestics,
he delivered into the care of the proper individuals
his kneading troughs, his kitchen utensils,
his cards, looms, spinning wheels, and so on; and,
pointing out the places where all these, when not
in use, should be placed, committed them to their
custody.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the holiday, or show articles, more account
was made. These, being brought forward only on
solemn festivals, or in honour of some foreign guest,
were entrusted to the immediate care of the housekeeper,
a complete list of everything having first been
taken; and it was part of her duty, when she delivered
any of these articles to the inferior domestics,
to make a note of what she gave out, and take care
they were duly returned into her keeping.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c012'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the above comprehensive glance over the articles
of furniture made use of in an Athenian gentleman’s
establishment, though it may give some notion
of the careful and economical habits of the people,
affords no conception of the splendour and magnificence
often found in a Grecian house: for, as we
have already seen, their opinions are highly erroneous
who imagine that in the Attic democracy the rich
were by any prudential or political considerations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>restrained from indulging their love of ostentation
by the utmost display they could make of wealth.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c012'><sup>[380]</sup></a>
In fact, not content with outstripping their neighbours
in the grandeur of their dwellings, furniture,
and dress, these persons had often the ludicrous vanity,
when they gave a large party, to excite the envy of
such dinnerless rogues as might pass, by throwing out
the feathers of game and poultry before their doors.<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c012'><sup>[381]</sup></a>
Indeed, since the Athenians exactly resembled other
men, the exhibition of magnificence tended but too
strongly to dazzle them; so that, among the arts of
designing politicians, one generally was, to create a
popular persuasion that they possessed the means of
conferring important favours on all who obliged them.</p>

<p class='c001'>To proceed, however, with the furniture. Though
the principal value of many articles arose from the exquisite
taste displayed in the design and workmanship,
the materials themselves, too, were often extremely
rare and costly. Porcelain, glass, crystal, ivory, amber,<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c012'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
gold, silver, and bronze, with numerous varieties
of precious woods, were wrought up with inimitable
taste and fancy into various articles of use or luxury.
Among the decorations of the dining-room was the
side-board, which, though sometimes of iron, was more
frequently of carved wood, bronze, or wrought silver,
ornamented with the heads of satyrs and oxen.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c012'><sup>[383]</sup></a> Their
tables, in the Homeric age, were generally of wood,
of variegated colours, finely polished, and with ornamented
feet. Myrleanos, an obscure writer in Athenæus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>imagines<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c012'><sup>[384]</sup></a> they were round, that they might
resemble the disc of the sun and moon; but from
the passage in the Odyssey,<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c012'><sup>[385]</sup></a> and the interpretation
of Eustathius, they may be inferred to have been narrow
parallelograms,<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c012'><sup>[386]</sup></a> like our own dining-tables. The
luxury of table-cloths being unknown, the wine spilled,
&amp;c., was cleansed away with sponges.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c012'><sup>[387]</sup></a> But the poet
had witnessed a superior degree of magnificence, for
he already, in the Odyssey,<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c012'><sup>[388]</sup></a> makes mention of tables
of silver. The poor were, of course, content with the
commonest wood. But as civilisation proceeded, the
tables of the wealthy became more and more costly
in materials, and more elegant in form.</p>

<p class='c001'>It grew to be an object of commerce, to import
from foreign countries the most curious kinds of
wood,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c012'><sup>[389]</sup></a> to be wrought into tables, which originally
supported on four legs, rested afterwards on three,
fancifully formed, or on a pillar and claws of ivory,
or silver, as with us. There was a celebrated species
of table manufactured in the island of Rhenea;<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c012'><sup>[390]</sup></a>
the great, among the Persians, delighted in maple
tables with ivory feet, and, in fact, the knotted
maple appears at one time to have been regarded
as the most rare and beautiful of woods.<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c012'><sup>[391]</sup></a> But
the rage for sumptuous articles of furniture of this
kind did not reach its full height until Roman
times, when a single table of citron wood</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>(Gorgeous feasts</div>
      <div class='line'>On citron tables or Atlantic stone)<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c012'><sup>[392]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>sometimes cost six or seven thousand pounds sterling.
Already, however, in the best ages of Greece,
their tables were inlaid with silver, brass, or ivory,
with feet in the form of lions, leopards, or other
wild beasts.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c012'><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In more early times, before the effeminate Oriental
habit of reclining at meals obtained,<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c012'><sup>[394]</sup></a> the
Greeks made use of chairs which were of various
kinds, some being formed of more, others of less
costly materials, but all beautiful and elegant in
form, as we may judge from those which adorn our
own drawing-rooms, entirely fashioned after Grecian
models. The thrones of the gods represented in
works of art, however richly ornamented, are simply
arm-chairs with upright backs, an example of which
occurs in a carnelian in the Orleans Collection,<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c012'><sup>[395]</sup></a>
where Apollo is represented playing on the seven-stringed
lyre. This chair has four legs with tigers’
feet, a very high upright back, and is ornamented
with a sculptured car and horses. They had no
Epicurean notions of their deities, and never presented
them to the eye of the public lounging in
an easy chair, which would have suggested the idea
of infirmity. On the contrary, they are full of force
and energy, and sit erect on their thrones, as ready
to succour their worshipers at a moment’s warning.
In the Homeric age these were richly carved, like
the divans, adorned with silver studs, and so high
that they required a footstool.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c012'><sup>[396]</sup></a> The throne of the
Persian kings was of massive gold, and stood beneath
a purple canopy, supported by four slender
golden columns thickly crusted with jewels.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Bedsteads were generally of common wood such as
deal,<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c012'><sup>[397]</sup></a> bottomed sometimes with planks, pierced to
admit air, sometimes with ox-hide thongs,<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c012'><sup>[398]</sup></a> which
in traversing each other left numerous open spaces
between them. Odysseus’s bedstead, which the hero
was sufficient joiner to manufacture with his own
hands, was made of olive-wood, inlaid with silver,
gold, and ivory. Sometimes the bed was supported
by a sort of netting of strong cord, stretched across
the bedstead, and made fast all round.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c012'><sup>[399]</sup></a> Later
ages witnessed far greater luxury,—bedsteads of
solid silver,<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c012'><sup>[400]</sup></a> or ivory embossed with figures wrought
with infinite art and delicacy,<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c012'><sup>[401]</sup></a> or of precious woods
carved, with feet of ivory or amber.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c012'><sup>[402]</sup></a> Occasionally,
also, they were veneered with Indian tortoiseshell,
inlaid with gold.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c012'><sup>[403]</sup></a> This taste would appear to have
flowed from the East, where among the kings of
Persia still greater magnificence was witnessed even
in very early times. Thus, speaking of the royal
feast celebrated at Susa, the Scripture says, there
were in the court of the garden of the king’s
palace “white, green, and blue hangings, fastened
with cords of fine linen and purple to silver
rings, and pillars of marble. The beds were of
gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and
blue, and white, and black marble.” A similar
style of grandeur is attributed by Hellenic writers
to the Persian king, who, according to Chares,<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c012'><sup>[404]</sup></a> reclined
in his palace on a couch shaded by a spreading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>golden vine, the grape clusters of which were
imitated by jewels of various colours.</p>

<p class='c001'>Four-post bedsteads were in use in remoter ages,
as appears from a white sardonyx in the Orleans
Collection,<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c012'><sup>[405]</sup></a> representing the surprisal of Ares and
Aphrodite, by Hephæstos. There is a low floating
vallance fastened up in festoons, the tester is roof-shaped,
and the pillars terminate in fanciful capitals.
The figure of an eagle adorns the corners of the
bedstead below. From a painting on the walls of
Pompeii we discover, that the peculiar sort of bedstead
at present found almost universally in France
was likewise familiar to the ancients, made exactly
after the same fashion, and raised about the same
height above the floor. With regard to the beds
themselves they were at different times manufactured
from very different materials, and those of
some parts of Greece enjoyed a peculiar reputation.
From a phrase in Homer,<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c012'><sup>[406]</sup></a> it would appear that, in
his times, beds were stuffed in Thessaly with very
fine grass. Those of Chios and Miletos were famous<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c012'><sup>[407]</sup></a>
throughout Greece. In other parts of the country,
persons of peculiar effeminacy slept on beds of sponge.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c012'><sup>[408]</sup></a>
Sicily was famous for its pillows, as were also several
other Doric countries. At Athens the rich were accustomed
to sleep upon very soft beds, placed on
bedsteads considerably above the floor;<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c012'><sup>[409]</sup></a> and sometimes,
it has been supposed, adorned with coverlets
of dressed peacocks’ skins with the feathers on.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c012'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the Greeks appear to have consulted their
ease, and sunk more completely into softness and
effeminacy, in proportion as they approached the
East. Among the Peloponnesians most persons lived
hard and lay hard; greater refinement and luxury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>prevailed in Attica; but in Ionia and many of the
Ægæan isles the great—although there were exceptions
as in the case of Attalos—fell little short in
self-indulgence of Median or Persian satraps. Some
idea may be formed of their habits in this respect
from the description of a Paphian prince’s bed by
Clearchos of Soli.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c012'><sup>[411]</sup></a> Over the soft mattresses supported
by a silver-footed bedstead, was flung a short
grained Sardian carpet of the most expensive kind.
A coverlet of downy texture succeeded, and upon
this was cast a costly counterpane of Amorginian
purple. Cushions, striped or variegated with the
richest purple, supported his head, while two soft
Dorian pillows<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c012'><sup>[412]</sup></a> of pale pink gently raised his feet.
In this manner habited in a milk-white chlamys the
prince reclined. Their bolsters in form resembled
our own;<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c012'><sup>[413]</sup></a> but the pillows were usually square, as
in France, though occasionally rounded off at both
ends, and covered with richly chequered or variegated
muslins. To prevent the fine wool or whatever
else they were stuffed with from getting into
heaps, mattresses were sewn through as now, and
carefully tufted that the packthread might not break
through the ticking.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c012'><sup>[414]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the Orientals it is common at present for
persons to sleep in their day apparel; but even in
the heroic ages it was already customary in Greece
to undress on going to bed. When Agamemnon
is roused before dawn by the delusive dream, the
whole process of the morning toilette is described.
First, says the poet, he donned his soft chiton which
was new and very handsome; next his pelisse; after
which he bound on his elegant sandals and suspended
his silver-hilted sword from his shoulder. Thus
accoutred he issued forth, sceptre in hand, towards
the ships.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c012'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>In Syria, children luxuriously educated are said to
have been rocked in their cradles wrapped in coverlets
of Milesian wool.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c012'><sup>[416]</sup></a> The sheep of Miletos were, in
fact, the Merinos of antiquity; and their wool being
celebrated for its fineness and softness, it was not
only employed in manufacturing the best cloths, but
also in stuffing the mattresses of kings and other
great personages who thought much of their ease.
And as the vulgar imagine they become great by
habiting themselves in garments similar to those of
their princes, like the honest man who sought wisdom
through reading by Epictetus’ lamp, the stuffs,
couches, and coverlets of Miletos got into great vogue
among the ancients. Virgil, Cicero, Servius, Columella,
and many other writers speak accordingly of
their excellence, and their testimonies have, with
wonderful industry, been collected by the learned
Bochart.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c012'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But though Miletos had a reputation for this kind
of manufacture, it by no means enjoyed a monopoly.
The scarlet coverings of Sardis, and the variegated
stuffs of Cyprus, produced by the famous weaver Akesas
and his son Helicon,<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c012'><sup>[418]</sup></a> appear in many instances to
have obtained a preference over all others. Pathymias,
too, the Egyptian, distinguished himself in the
same line.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c012'><sup>[419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>All these bed-coverings were commonly perfumed
with fragrant essences,<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c012'><sup>[420]</sup></a> for which reason the voluptuous
poets of antiquity dwell with a sort of rapture
on the pleasure of rolling about in bed. Ephippos
exclaims:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“How I delight</div>
      <div class='line'>To spring upon the dainty coverlets;</div>
      <div class='line'>Breathing the perfume of the rose, and steeped</div>
      <div class='line'>In tears of myrrh!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Aristophanes, likewise, and Sophron, the mimographer,
make mention of these fragrant counterpanes,
which were extremely costly, and inwrought, according
to the latter, with figures of birds.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c012'><sup>[421]</sup></a> Elsewhere
Athenæus relates that the Persian carpets contained
representations of men, animals, and monsters.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c012'><sup>[422]</sup></a> Their
blankets, like our own, were plain white; but even
so far back as the heroic ages, the upper coverings, as
being partly designed for show, were of rich and various
colours.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c012'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There seems to be good ground for believing, that
if the Greeks did not borrow their philosophy from
the East, they at least derived from them many of the
vain and luxurious habits which at length rendered
that philosophy of none effect. No one appears to
have paid a single visit to Persia, or Syria, or Egypt,
without bringing back along with him some pestilent
new freak in the matter of dress or furniture, wholly
at variance with republican simplicity. We might
adduce numerous anecdotes in proof of this. For the
present we confine ourselves to the following. Among
the Persians, renowned in all ages for sensual indulgences,
it was judged of so much importance to
enjoy soft and elegantly arranged beds, that in great
houses persons were employed who attended only to
this. An anecdote in illustration has been preserved
by Athenæus. Timagoras, or, according to Phanias,
Entimos of Gortyna, envying Themistocles his reception
at the court of Persia, undertook himself a toad-eating
expedition to that country. Artaxerxes, whose
ear could tolerate more flatterers than one, took the
Cretan into favour, and made him a present of a
superb marquee, a silver-footed bedstead, with costly
furniture, and, along with them, sent a slave, as a
Turkish pasha would send a cook or a pipe-lighter,
because, in his opinion, the Greeks who prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>sleeping-places for so many Persians at Marathon and
Platæa, understood nothing of bed-making.</p>

<p class='c001'>Entimos evidently excelled the great Athenian
in the arts of a courtier. In fact, he was the very
prototype of Hajji Baba, and enjoyed even still greater
influence over the Shah than the illustrious barber’s
son of Ispahan. Charmed by his cajolery, Artaxerxes
invited him to his private table, where, usually,
none but princes of the blood were admitted,<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c012'><sup>[424]</sup></a> an
honour, as Phanias assures us, which no other Greek
ever enjoyed. For, though Timagoras of Athens
performed <em>kou-tou</em> before the throne,<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c012'><sup>[425]</sup></a> whereby he
obtained great consideration among a nation of slaves,
and was hanged when he got home, he was not invited
to hob-and-nob with his majesty, but only
enjoyed the distinction of having certain dishes sent
him from the king’s table. To Antalcidas, the Spartan,
Artaxerxes sent his crown dipped in liquid perfume,
an agreeable compliment, but which he more
than once paid to Entimos, whose extraordinary favour
at court in the long run, however, awakened
the envy of the Persians. The canopy of the marquee
presented to this Cretan was spangled with
bright flowers, and, among the other articles of which
the imperial gift consisted, were a throne of massive
silver, a gilded parasol, several golden cups crusted
with jewels, a hundred maple-tables with ivory feet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>a hundred goblets of silver, several vases of the same
precious metal, a hundred female slaves, an equal
number of youths, with six thousand pieces of gold,
besides what was furnished him for his daily expenditure.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c012'><sup>[426]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A gentleman travelling in Ireland witnessed the
ingenuity of that ready-witted people in applying the
same thing to various uses: first, he saw the tablecloth,
on which he had eaten a good supper, transferred
as a sheet to his bed, and, next morning, his
kind hostess, offering her services to put him in the
right way, converted the same article into a mantle,
which she wrapped about her shoulders. The Greeks
were almost equally ingenious. With them what
was a cloak by day became sometimes a counterpane
at night,<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c012'><sup>[427]</sup></a> in addition, perhaps, to the ordinary
bed-clothes; for it is clear they loved to be
warm, from the somewhat reproachful allusion of
Strepsiades in the “Clouds” to the five <em>sisyræ</em>,<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c012'><sup>[428]</sup></a> rolled
snugly up in which, his son, Pheidippides, could
sleep while thoughts of his debts bit the old man
like so many bugs, and roused him hours before
day to consult his ledgers. All kinds of stromata
were, in Plato’s time, divided into two classes, first,
coverings for the body, such as cloaks, mantles, and
so on; secondly, bed-clothes, properly so called.</p>

<p class='c001'>The walls of their chambers were frequently hung
with Milesian tapestry, a custom to which Amphis
alludes in his Odysseus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A. Milesian hangings line your walls, you scent</div>

      <div class='line'>Knew you before of such a fumigation?<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c012'><sup>[430]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Mention is likewise made among the ancients of
purple tapestry, inwrought with pearls and gold.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c012'><sup>[431]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Carthage enjoyed celebrity for its manufacture of
carpets and variegated pillows,<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c012'><sup>[432]</sup></a> a piece of luxury
which, as we have seen above, had already been
introduced in the heroic ages; for Homer, in innumerable
passages, speaks of rare and costly carpets,
and these were not only spread over couches and
seats, but over the floor likewise.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c012'><sup>[433]</sup></a> Rolled up, they
would occasionally appear to have served for pillows.
The manufacture of carpets had, moreover, been carried
to considerable perfection, for the poet speaks
of some with a soft pile on both sides, which were
evidently very splendid.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c012'><sup>[434]</sup></a> Theocritus,<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c012'><sup>[435]</sup></a> too, in his
Adoniazusæ, enumerates, among the luxuries of the
youthful God,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Carpets of purple, <em>softer far than sleep</em>,<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c012'><sup>[436]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Woven in Milesian looms.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But in nothing did the Greeks display a more gorgeous
or costly taste than in what may be termed
their <em>plate</em>, which was not only fabricated of the rarest
materials, but wrought likewise with all the elaborateness
and delicacy and richness of design within
the reach of art. Among the Macedonians, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>their Eastern conquests, gold plate appears not to
have been uncommon; for at the grand supper described
by Hippolochos in his letter to Lynceus, every
guest is said to have used it.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c012'><sup>[437]</sup></a> The predilection for
this sort of magnificence they acquired in Asia, where,
at a banquet given to Alexander, the whole dessert
was brought in tastefully covered with gold-leaf.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c012'><sup>[438]</sup></a> In
the reign of his father, Philip, the precious metals
were rare in Macedonia. Indeed, that crafty old
monarch, possessing but one gold cup in the world,
had so good an opinion of his courtiers that, to prevent
their thieving it, he slept every night with it
under his pillow.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c012'><sup>[439]</sup></a> Gold was, more early, plentiful in
Attica. Alcibiades, with tastes and habits unsuited
to a democracy, carried so far his love of display as
to make use of thuribles, or censers, and wash-hand
basins of pure gold.<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c012'><sup>[440]</sup></a> But the ostentatious son of
Clinias, though extravagant, was in this respect only
a type of his nation. Every rich citizen of Athens
aimed at the same degree of splendour; and, in describing
his town-house or favourite villa, might, with
little alteration, have adopted the language of the
poet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——“My house within the city</div>
      <div class='line'>Is richly furnished with plate and gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands:</div>
      <div class='line'>My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry.</div>
      <div class='line'>In ivory coffers have I stuffed my crowns;</div>
      <div class='line'>In cypress chests my arras, counterpanes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl,</div>
      <div class='line'>Vallance of Venice, gold in needle-work,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pewter and brass, and all things that belong</div>
      <div class='line'>To house or housekeeping.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Socrates, in the Republic, speaking of what the
prevailing fashion required to be found in a city,
makes out a list of good things, not much inferior
upon the whole to Shakspeare’s,—beds, tables, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>other furniture; dainties of all kinds; perfumes, unguents,
sauces, &amp;c.; to which the philosopher adds
apparel, shoes, pictures, tapestry, ivory, and gold:<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c012'><sup>[441]</sup></a>
and these rare materials, as farther on he observes,
were wrought into utensils for domestic purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most plentifully furnished departments
of a Greek house was the <em>Kulikeion</em>, or “cupboard,”
usually closed in front with a curtain,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c012'><sup>[442]</sup></a> where they
kept their goblets, cups, and drinking-horns, under
the protection of a statue of Hermes, who, as god
of thieves, would, it was supposed, be respected by
his children. The form and workmanship of these
materials varied, no doubt, according to the taste and
means of the possessor; but they were in general distinguished
for the elegance of their outline, the grace
and originality of the sculpture, the fineness, delicacy,
and minute finish of the execution. It is well
known, as an able antiquarian<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c012'><sup>[443]</sup></a> has remarked, to what
an excess the luxury of the table was carried among
the ancients, and how much they surpassed us in the
dimensions, the massiveness, the workmanship, the
quality, and the variety of their drinking apparatus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many persons, however, seem chiefly to have valued
their plate as a mark of their wealth and magnificence;
among whom may be reckoned Pythias of
Phigaleia, who, when dying, commanded the following
epitaph to be inscribed upon his tomb:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Here jolly Pythias lies,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>A right honest man, and wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who of goblets had very great store,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Of amber, silver, gold,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>All glorious to behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>In number ne’er equalled before.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c012'><sup>[444]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Amber goblets not being, I believe, in fashion
among the modern nations of Europe, some doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>may be experienced respecting the veracity of our
friend of Phigaleia; but the ancients had other gobletary
legends to bring forward in support of it. Helen,<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c012'><sup>[445]</sup></a>
it is said, justly proud of her beautiful bosom, dedicated
in one of the temples of Rhodes, as a votive
offering, an amber goblet, exactly of the size and
shape of one of her breasts, which, had it come down
to posterity, might have furnished artists with a perfect
model of that part of the female form. However
this may be, the ancients, in remote ages, set a great
value on their cups, particularly such as were considered
heir-looms in the family, and laid apart to be
used only on extraordinary occasions. Hence Œdipos,
in the old Cyclic poet, is seized with fierce anger at
his son, who had, contrary to his will, brought forth
his old hereditary goblets to be used at an ordinary
entertainment.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

      <div class='line'>Pronounced fierce imprecations, wished his sons</div>

      <div class='line'>But plunge in feuds and slaughters, and contend</div>
      <div class='line'>For their inheritance: and the Furies heard.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c012'><sup>[446]</sup></a></div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Agathocles, tyrant of Sicily, appears to have been
an amateur of cups, and would sometimes while exhibiting
his collection to his friends make a good-humoured
allusion to his original occupation. “These
golden vessels,” said he, “have been made out of those
earthenware ones which I formerly manufactured.”<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c012'><sup>[447]</sup></a>
Drinking-bowls in fact made no inconsiderable figure
in ancient times. They were bestowed as the prizes
in gymnastic contests, and in Greece men boxed and
wrestled for the cup as horses run for it in England.
Parasites, like the jester of Louis XIV., used
sometimes to carry home the cups and dishes set
before them at dinner; but the tables were often
turned when the subject gave and the prince pocketed
the dole.</p>

<p class='c001'>A curious legend has been preserved to us connected
with the subject of cups. Several princes
uniting, in remote times, to send a colony to Lesbos,
were commanded by an oracle to cast a virgin,
during their voyage, into the sea, as a sacrifice
to Poseidon. Obedience, in those superstitious ages,
was seldom refused to such injunctions. The maiden
was precipitated into the waves, but Enallos, one of
the chiefs, in whom love had quenched the reverence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>for oracles, immediately plunged in to save her. Neither
the chief, however, nor the virgin appeared again,
and the fleet proceeded. The remainder of the tradition
may be illustrated by an event said to have
taken place in the Tonga islands.<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c012'><sup>[448]</sup></a> They were probably
near some uninhabited isle, and instead of
rising to the surface of the sea, emerged into a
cavern elevated considerably above its level, and
opening perhaps upon the land. “God tempers the
wind to the shorn lamb,” says a modern writer, and
so Enallos found it. By means unrevealed in the
ancient narrative, the hero and his bride continued
to subsist on the rock, and many years afterwards,
when the colony was already flourishing, he one
day presented himself before his old friends at Methymna,
and entertained them with a very romantic
account of his residence among the Nereids at the
bottom of the sea, where he was honoured with the
care of Poseidon’s horses when sent out to grass.
At length, however, getting on the back of a large
wave it bore him upwards and he escaped from the
deep, bearing in his hand a golden cup, the metal
of which was so marvellously beautiful that in comparison
ordinary gold appeared no better than brass.<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c012'><sup>[449]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Even the loftiest and least worldly-minded of the
Homeric heroes, Achilles, set great value on a favourite
drinking-cup, which he preserved for his own
particular use, and for pouring out libations to Zeus
alone. Priam<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c012'><sup>[450]</sup></a> was careful to include a rare goblet
in the ransom of Hector’s body, and a similar gift
aided in alluring Alcmena from the paths of virtue.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c012'><sup>[451]</sup></a>
But the most famous bowl of antiquity was that of
Heracles, which, more capacious than the barber’s
basin in Don Quixote, served its illustrious owner in
the double capacity of a drinking-cup and a canoe;
for when he had quenched his thirst, he could set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>his bowl afloat, and, leaping into it, steer to any part
of the world he pleased. Some, indeed, speak of it
as a borrowed article, belonging originally to the
Sun, and in which the god used nightly to traverse
the ocean from West to East.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c012'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To pass, however, over the goblets of mythology.
It was fashionable to possess plate of this kind finely
sculptured with historical arguments; and history has
preserved the names of Cimon and Athenocles, two
artists who excelled in this style of engraving. These
cups were sometimes of silver gilt, sometimes of massive
gold crusted with jewels.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c012'><sup>[453]</sup></a> In addition to the
two artists named above, we may enumerate Crates,
Stratonicos, Myrmecides of Miletos, Callicrates the
Lacedemonian, and Mys, whose “Cup of Heracles,”
celebrated in antiquity, had represented upon it the
storming of Ilion, with this inscription,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The names by which the ancients distinguished
their several kinds of goblets are too numerous to
be here given. Some were curious—“Amalthea’s
Horn,” “The Year,” &amp;c. Rustics made use of two-handled
wooden bowls in which, when thirsty, they
drew fresh milk from the cow in the fields.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c012'><sup>[455]</sup></a> There
was a big-bellied cup with a narrow neck which
being shaped like a purse, participated with this
very necessary article in the name of Aryballos.<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c012'><sup>[456]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Glass cups of much beauty were manufactured in
great abundance at Alexandria. Among these was
the <em>Baucalis</em>, mentioned by Sopater the parodist, who
says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>’Tis sweet in early morn to cool the lips</div>
      <div class='line'>With pure fresh water from the gushing fount,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mingled with honey in the Baucalis,</div>
      <div class='line'>When one o’er night has made too free with wine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feels sharp thirst.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c012'><sup>[457]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The glass-workers of Alexandria procured earthenware
vessels from all parts of the world, which they
used as models for their cups. Even the great
sculptor Lysippos did not disdain to employ his genius
in the invention of a new kind of vase. Having
made a collection of vessels of many various shapes,
and diligently studied the whole, he hit upon a form
entirely new, and presented the model to Cassander,
who having just then founded the city of Cassandria,
was ambitious of originating an invention of this
kind. He was desirous, perhaps, of recommending
by the elegance of his drinking-cups the Mendæan
wine exported in great quantities from his city.<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c012'><sup>[458]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There was a peculiar kind of cup called Grammateion,
from the letters of gold chased upon its
exterior.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c012'><sup>[459]</sup></a> Alexis mentions one of this sort in the
following lines:</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A. But let me first describe the cup; ’twas round,</div>

<p class='c014'>A very handsome sort of cup was imported from
Sidon. It had two handles, and was ornamented with
small figures in relief. Drinking-vases were also
formed from the large horns of the Molossian and
Pœonian oxen; and these articles were commonly
rimmed with silver or gold.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c012'><sup>[461]</sup></a> Small cups were made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>little account of. There was even one kind of bowl
which, for its enormous capacity, was called the Elephant.</p>

<p class='c014'>A very celebrated cup among the Athenians was
the Thericlean,<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c012'><sup>[463]</sup></a> originally invented by Thericles, a
Corinthian potter, contemporary with Aristophanes.
This ware was black, highly varnished, with gilt
edges;<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c012'><sup>[464]</sup></a> but the name came afterwards to be applied
to any vessel of the same form from whatever
materials manufactured. There were accordingly
Thericlea of gold with wooden stands. The cups
of this kind, made at Athens, being very expensive,
an inferior sort, in imitation, was produced at Rhodes,
which, as far more economical, had a great run among
the humbler classes. The Thericlean was a species
of deep chalice with two handles, and bulging but
little at the sides. Theophrastus<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c012'><sup>[465]</sup></a> speaks of Thericlea
turned from the Syrian Turpentine tree, the
wood of which being black and taking a fine polish,
it was impossible at a glance to distinguish them
from those of earthenware. The paintings on these
utensils appear to have been various. Sometimes
a single wreath of ivy encircled them immediately beneath
the golden rim; but it seems occasionally to
have been covered with representations of animals,
which gave rise to a forced and false etymology of
the name.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c012'><sup>[466]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>We have already observed, that the use of drinking-horns<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c012'><sup>[467]</sup></a>
was not unknown to the ancients. In fact,
it seems, in very remote ages, to have been customary
to convert bulls’ horns into cups with very little
preparation; and the practice of quaffing wine from
this rude kind of goblet had by some been supposed
to have suggested the idea to artists of representing
Bacchos with horns, and to poets the epithet of the
Bull Dionysos. He was moreover worshiped at
Cyzicos under the form of a bull. Afterwards, as
taste and luxury advanced, these simple vessels were
exchanged for horns of silver, which Pindar attributes
to the Centaurs.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c012'><sup>[468]</sup></a> Xenophon<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c012'><sup>[469]</sup></a> found drinking-horns
among the Paphlagonians, and afterwards even
in the palace of the Thracian king Seuthes. Æschylus
speaks of silver horns, with lids of gold, in use
among the Perrhæbians, and Sophocles, in his Pandora,
makes mention of drinking-horns of massive
gold. Philip of Macedon was accustomed among
his friends to drink from the common horn. Golden
horns were found among the inhabitants of Cythera.
Horns of silver were in use at Athens; and, among
the articles enumerated as sold at a public auction,
mention is made of one of these vessels of a twisted
form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mirrors constituted another article of Hellenic
luxury. These were sometimes of brass,<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c012'><sup>[470]</sup></a> whence
the proverb:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As forms by brass, so minds by wine are mirrored.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c012'><sup>[471]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The best, however, until those of glass came into
use, were made of silver or of a mixed metal, the exact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>composition of which is not now known. Another
kind was fashioned from a species of carbuncle found
near the city of Orchomenos,<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c012'><sup>[472]</sup></a> in Arcadia. Glass
mirrors<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c012'><sup>[473]</sup></a> also came early into use, chiefly manufactured,
at the outset, by the Phœnicians of Sidon.
The hand-mirrors were usually circular,<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c012'><sup>[474]</sup></a> and set in
costly frames. To prevent their being speedily tarnished
they were, when not in use, carefully enclosed
in cases.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c012'><sup>[475]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There were mirrors, too, of polished silver, fashioned
so as to magnify immensely the objects they reflected.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c012'><sup>[476]</sup></a>
They invented also large cups containing within
many diminutive mirrors, so that when any one looked
into them, his eye was met by a multitude of faces
all resembling his own.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c012'><sup>[477]</sup></a> In a temple of Hera in
Arcadia, was a mirror fixed in the wall, wherein
the spectator could at first scarcely, if at all, discern
his own image, while the throne of the goddess and
the statues of the other deities ranged around were
most brilliantly <a id='corr119.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='reflected,'>reflected.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_119.20'><ins class='correction' title='reflected,'>reflected.</ins></a></span><a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c012'><sup>[478]</sup></a> Many sorts of mirrors
appear to have been made for the purpose of playing
off practical jokes. For example, looking in one
of these, a handsome woman would find her visage
transformed into that of a Gorgon, so as to appear
terrible even to herself. Others again were so very
flattering, that a half-starved barber, viewing his
figure therein, appeared to be gifted with the thewes
of a Heracles. Another sort distorted the countenance,
or inverted it, or showed merely the half.</p>

<p class='c001'>Religion was the nurse of the fine arts, and first
gave rise, not only to sculpture and painting, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>also to those private collections of statues and pictures<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c012'><sup>[479]</sup></a>
in which we discover the germs of our modern
galleries<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c012'><sup>[480]</sup></a> and museums. The first step was
made towards these when the Greek set up the
images of his household gods upon his hearth.
Thence, step by step, he proceeded, improving the
appearance, enriching the materials, increasing the
number of his domestic deities, with which niche
after niche was filled, till his private dwelling became
in some sort a temple. The religious feeling,
no doubt, made way, in many cases, for a
passion for show, or a nascent taste for the beautiful;
so that rude figures in terra-cotta, wood, or
stone, were gradually replaced by exquisite statues
in ivory, gold, or silver,<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c012'><sup>[481]</sup></a> or the fairest marble,
breathing beauty and life, with eyes of gems, and
clothed with majesty as with a garment. Hence
flowed the passion for mimetic representations and
all the plastic arts. The gods were transferred from
the fireside to the temple, to the agora, to the
senate-house, to the innumerable porticoes everywhere
abounding in Greece.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c012'><sup>[482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On their superb candelabra,<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c012'><sup>[483]</sup></a> &amp;c., matter for a
curious volume might be collected. The lamps in
common use,<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c012'><sup>[484]</sup></a> though sometimes very beautiful in
shape, were of course fictile,<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c012'><sup>[485]</sup></a> such as we find in
great numbers among the ruins of Greek cities, both
in the mother-country, and in their Egyptian and
other colonies. Sometimes, however, they were of
bronze, silver, or massive gold. A very beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>specimen in this last metal was found, by Lord
Belmore, among the ruins of an Egyptian temple, a
short time before my visit to the Nile. In many
houses were magnificent chandeliers, suspended from
the ceiling, with numerous branches, which filled
the apartments<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c012'><sup>[486]</sup></a> with a flood of light. The most
remarkable article of this kind which I remember
was that set up as a votive offering to Hestia, in
the Prytaneion of Tarentum, by Dionysios the
Younger, which held as many lamps as there are
days in the year.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c012'><sup>[487]</sup></a> Among people of humble condition
wooden chandeliers, or candlesticks, were in
use.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c012'><sup>[488]</sup></a> In remoter ages they burned slips of pine-branches,
the bark of various trees, &amp;c., instead of
lamps. They were acquainted with the use of horn
and wicker lanterns.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c012'><sup>[489]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another kind of decoration of Greek houses we
must not overlook,—their armour and implements
of war,<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c012'><sup>[490]</sup></a> with which the poet Alcæos<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c012'><sup>[491]</sup></a> loved to adorn
his chambers, though, like Paris, he cared little to
make any other use of them. “My spacious mansion,”
exclaims he, “gleams throughout with brazen
arms. Even along the ceiling are ranged
the ornaments of Ares, glittering helmets, surmounted
by white nodding plumes; greaves of polished
brass are suspended on the walls, with cuirasses
of linen, while, here and there, about my
apartments, are scattered hollow shields. Elsewhere,
you behold scimitars of Chalcis, and baldricks,
and the short vest which we wear beneath our
armour.”<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c012'><sup>[492]</sup></a> Besides the articles enumerated by the
poet, there were shield-cases, sheaths for their spears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>quivers curiously adorned, feathered arrows, and bows
of polished horn, tipped at either end with gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these gorgeous and costly commodities the
reader, we fear, will be reluctant to accompany us
into the kitchen, where we must pick our way among
kneading-troughs, pots and pans, Delphian cutlery<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c012'><sup>[493]</sup></a>
and honey-jars.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c012'><sup>[494]</sup></a> But as without these the warriors,
as Homer himself acknowledges, could make but
little use of their weapons, it is absolutely necessary
we should inquire into their cooking conveniences.
To commence, however, we must allow<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c012'><sup>[495]</sup></a> Clearchos
of Soli, to enumerate a few of the articles found
among the furniture of this important part of the
house. There was, first, says he, a three-legged
table, then a chytra, or earthen pot, which, as in
France, was always preferred for making soup. It
was not, however, of coarse brown ware, as with
us; for, Socrates, in his conversation with Hippias
on the Beautiful, observes that, when properly made,
round, smooth, and well-baked, the chytra was very
handsome, particularly that large sort which contained
upwards of seven gallons. It had two
handles, and was evidently glazed.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c012'><sup>[496]</sup></a> In stirring the
chytra while boiling, the Attic cook made choice
of a ladle turned from the wood of the fig-tree,
which, it is said, communicated an agreeable flavour
to the soup, and, in Socrates’s opinion, was preferable
to one of gold which, being very weighty,
might chance to crack the pot, spill the broth, and
extinguish the fire.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c012'><sup>[497]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There was used in the kitchen a sort of candelabrum,
or lamp-stand, which Clearchos merely names.
Then followed the mortar, the stool, the sponge,
the cauldron, the kneading-trough, the mug, the oil-flask,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the rush-basket, the large knife, the cleaver,<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c012'><sup>[498]</sup></a>
the wooden platter, the bowl, and the larding-pin.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c012'><sup>[499]</sup></a>
Pollux, who had, doubtless, served an apprenticeship
to Marcus Aurelius’s cook, gives a formidable
list of culinary utensils, from which we must be content
to select the most remarkable. First, however,
we shall show how important a piece of sponge was
to an Athenian cook. It often saved him his dinner;
for, if any of his stewpans, crocks, or kettles,
had suffered from the embraces of Hephæstos,
in other words, had got a hole burnt in them, a
bit of sponge was drawn into the aperture, and on
went the cooking operations as before.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c012'><sup>[500]</sup></a> In some
houses culinary utensils were regarded as a nuisance,
the presence of which was not to be constantly endured,
and, accordingly, when the master desired to
treat his friends, cookey was despatched early in
the morning to hire pots and kettles of a broker.
To this custom Alexis alludes in his Exile:</p>

<p class='c014'>But we must not pass over the Pyreion or Trypanon,<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c012'><sup>[502]</sup></a>
the clumsy contrivance which supplied the
place of our lucifers, phosphorus, and tinder-boxes.
This was a hollow piece of wood, in which another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>piece was turned rapidly till sparks of fire flew out.<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c012'><sup>[503]</sup></a>
Soldiers carried these fire-kindlers along with them
as a necessary part of their kit.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ordinary fuel of the Greeks consisted chiefly
of wood and charcoal,<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c012'><sup>[504]</sup></a> (kept in rush or wicker baskets,)
though the use of mineral coal was not altogether
unknown to them.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c012'><sup>[505]</sup></a> In Attica, where wood was always
scarce, they economically made use of vine-cuttings,<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c012'><sup>[506]</sup></a>
and even the green branches of the fig tree
with the leaves on.<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c012'><sup>[507]</sup></a> The charcoal of Acharnæ, the
best probably in the country, was sometimes prepared
from the scarlet oak.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c012'><sup>[508]</sup></a> To prevent the wood,
used in their saloons, halls, and drawing-rooms from
smoking, it was often boiled<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c012'><sup>[509]</sup></a> in water or steeped in
dregs of oil. The use of the bellows<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c012'><sup>[510]</sup></a> was known
in Hellas from the remotest antiquity. They had
likewise a kind of osier flap, with a handle, and
shaped like a fan, which at times supplied the place
of a pair of bellows.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were chopping-blocks<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c012'><sup>[511]</sup></a> both of wood and
stone, mortars,<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c012'><sup>[512]</sup></a> fish-kettles, frying-pans, and spits of
all dimensions,<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c012'><sup>[513]</sup></a> some being so diminutive that thrushes
and other small birds could be roasted on them.
Their ends in the heroic ages rested on stone hobs,
but afterwards andirons were invented, probably of
fanciful shape as in modern France. Occasionally
they would appear to have been manufactured of
lead. To these we may add the ovens, the bean
and barley-roasters, the sieves of bronze and other
materials, the wine-strainers in the form of colanders,
the crate for earthern-ware, and the chafing-dish.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c012'><sup>[514]</sup></a></p>

I confess, I am not acquainted

votive offerings, representing
the female breast, may be seen
in the British Museum, among
the Elgin Marbles. But the most
curious relic of the ancient female
form is mentioned in the following
passage: “In the street just
out of the gate of this villa I
lately saw a skeleton dug out;
and by desiring the labourers
to remove the skull and bones
gently, I perceived distinctly
the perfect mould of every feature
of the face, and that the
eyes had been shut. I also saw
distinctly the impression of the
large folds of the drapery of the
toga, and some of the cloth itself
sticking to the earth. The
city was first covered by a
shower of hot pumice-stones and
ashes, and then by a shower of
small ashes mixed with water.
It was in the latter stratum
that the skeleton above described
was found. In the Museum
at Portici a piece of this
sort of hardened mud is preserved;
it is stamped with
the impression of the breast
of a woman, with a thin drapery
over it. The skeleton I
saw dug out was not above five
feet from the surface. It is
very extraordinary that the impression
of the body and face
should have remained from the
year 79 to this day, especially
as I found the earth so little
hardened that it separated upon
the least touch.”—Sir W. Hamilton,
Acc. of Discov. at Pompeii,
p. 15.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER III. <br /> FOOD OF HOMERIC TIMES—MEAT, FISH, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Having described the implements with which a
Greek meal was prepared, let us next inquire of
what materials it consisted, and how it was eaten.
There will be no occasion in pursuing this investigation
to adhere to any very strict method. It will probably
be sufficient to make a few broad divisions and
a flexible outline which we can fill up as the materials
fall in our way.</p>

<p class='c001'>What the original inhabitants of Hellas ate might
no doubt be satisfactorily inferred from the accounts
we possess of nations still existing in the same state
of civilisation. But it is nevertheless curious to examine
their traditions relating to the subject. Ælian,
who has preserved many notices of remote antiquity,
gives a list of various kinds of food, which, as
he would appear to think, constituted the chief, if
not the whole, sustenance of several ancient nations.
The Arcadians lived, he says, upon acorns; the Argives
upon pears, the Athenians upon figs;<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c012'><sup>[515]</sup></a> the wild
pear-tree furnished the Tirynthians with their favourite
food; a sort of cane was the chief dainty of the
Indians; of the Karamanians<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c012'><sup>[516]</sup></a> the date; millet of
the Mæotæ and Sauromatæ; while the Persians<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c012'><sup>[517]</sup></a> delighted
chiefly in cardamums and pistachio nuts.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c012'><sup>[518]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The tradition that while some degree of civilisation
already existed in the East, many tribes of
Hellas still subsisted upon acorns, has given rise
to much curious disquisition. It is abundantly clear,
however, that the fruit of our English oak is not
what is meant; for, upon this, no one who has
made the experiment will for one moment imagine
that man could subsist; but every kind of production
comprehended by the Greeks under the term
“acorn,” (βάλανος). Gerard, an old English botanist,
enumerates chestnuts among acorns, and Xenophon
calls dates “the acorns of the palm-tree.” The
mast, however, of a tree common in Greece, would,
as Mitford thinks, afford a not unwholesome nourishment,
though he is quite right in supposing that
it could not have been a favourite food in more
civilised times.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c012'><sup>[519]</sup></a> While upon the subject of acorns,
this ingenious and able writer appears disposed to
make somewhat merry with a certain project of
Socrates. If we rightly comprehend him, which
very possibly we do not, he means to accuse the
philosopher of reducing the citizens of his airy republic
to very short commons indeed,<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c012'><sup>[520]</sup></a> nothing but
a little beech-mast, and a few myrtle-berries. This
borders strongly on the notion of the comic writer,
who describes the Athenians as living on air and
hope. But though abstemious enough, Socrates
was not so unreasonable as to require even his Utopians
to fight and philosophise upon a diet so scanty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Before he comes to the mast and the myrtle-berries,
we find him enumerating wheaten and barley bread,
salt, olives, cheese, and truffles, together with pulse
and all such herbs as the fields spontaneously produce.
For a dessert he would indulge them with
figs, chickpeas, and beans, myrtle-berries, and beech-mast,
or chestnuts roasted in the fire. Plato was
aware how the luxurious wits of his time would
turn up their noses at such primitive diet, and therefore
brings in Glaucon inquiring,—“If you were
founding a polity of swine, what other food would
you provide for them?”<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c012'><sup>[521]</sup></a> Pausanias remarks, however,
that acorns long continued to be a common
article of food in Arcadia,<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c012'><sup>[522]</sup></a> but only those of the
fagus.<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c012'><sup>[523]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If we may credit some writers the ancient inhabitants
of Hellas made use of food much more
revolting than acorns, having been, in fact, cannibals
who devoured each other. There, no doubt,
existed among the Greeks of later times traditions
of a state of society in which human flesh was
eaten by certain fierce and lawless individuals, such
as Polyphemos, but nothing in their literature can
authorise us to infer that the practice was ever
general. Superstition seems on very extraordinary
occasions to have impelled them into the guilt of
human sacrifice, when the officiating priests, and,
perhaps, some few others, probably tasted of the
entrails, and Galen had conversed with individuals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>who had been led by mere curiosity to sup on man’s
flesh, and found its flavour to resemble that of tender
beef.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c012'><sup>[524]</sup></a> But instances of this kind prove nothing;
for how often does it not happen that mariners are
even now driven by distressful circumstances to
slaughter and eat their companions at sea! And
yet shall we on this account pass for anthropophagi
with posterity?</p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks, however, were not content with one
set of traditions, or upon the whole inclined to give
currency to the most gloomy. On the contrary,
their poets casting backward the light of their imagination,
and kindling up the landscapes of the far
past, called up the vision of the golden age, when
neither the domestic hearth<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c012'><sup>[525]</sup></a> nor the altars of the
gods were stained with blood, and the fruits of the
field,—milk, honey, cheese, and butter sufficed to
sustain life. But we must escape from these shadowy
times, and come down to the age of beef
and mutton.</p>

<p class='c001'>Food is, with great precision, divided by Aristotle
into moist and dry, that is, into meat and drink.<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c012'><sup>[526]</sup></a>
A classification, the credit of which, as Feith contends,
belongs to Homer.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c012'><sup>[527]</sup></a> In this poet, bread (σίτος),
the principal article of provision, is made indiscriminately
both from wheat and barley, though the
latter grain is thought to have been first in use.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c012'><sup>[528]</sup></a>
Herodotus found, in the matter of bread, a peculiar
taste among the Egyptians; barley and wheat they
despised, though in no country are finer produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>than in Egypt; giving, very strangely, the preference
to the <em>olyra</em>, by some supposed to be the
spelt, but more probably Syrian <em>dhourra</em>, ears of
which I observed sculptured on the interior of
the pronaos of Leto’s temple at Esneh. Bread, in
the Homeric age, was brought to table in a reed
basket, the use of silver bread-baskets, or trays, not
having been then, as Donatus thinks, introduced.
But in this the learned commentator is mistaken;
or, if they had no silver trays, at least they had
them of brass and gold, to match their tables of
massive silver.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c012'><sup>[529]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Next to bread, flesh, in the heroic ages, was the
greatest stay-stomach, particularly beef, kid, mutton,
and pork. They had not, however, as yet discovered
many ways of cooking it. Nearly all their
culinary ingenuity reduced itself in fact to roasting
and boiling, a circumstance which led Athenæus,<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c012'><sup>[530]</sup></a>
and the president Goguet to look back with great
pity and concern on these unhappy ages when even
princes, generally gourmands, were deprived of the
supreme felicity of dining on ragouts, soups, and
boiled brains. Servius,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c012'><sup>[531]</sup></a> too, and Varro are inclined
to participate in this feeling of commiseration, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the latter observes, that among their own ancestors
people were originally compelled to dine on roast
meat, though in the course of time the arts of boiling
and soup-making were introduced.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c012'><sup>[532]</sup></a> With regard
to Homer’s heroes, however, our sympathies
are somewhat relieved by finding, that learned men
have overrated the extent of their misfortunes.
They were not altogether ignorant of the art of
boiling, as Athenæus himself admits, where he mentions
the boiled shin of beef which one of the
drunken suitors flung at Odysseus’s head.</p>

<p class='c001'>The flesh of young animals was not habitually
eaten in those early ages, so that in denominating
them public devourers of kids and lambs, Priam
accuses his sons of scandalous luxury.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c012'><sup>[533]</sup></a> In fact,
with the design of preventing a scarcity of animal
food, a law was enacted at Athens prohibiting the
slaughter of an unshorn lamb, and from the same
motive the Emperor Valens forbade the use of
veal.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c012'><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But there was nothing beyond the difficulty of
catching it, to prevent the Homeric heroes from
making free with game, such as venison, and the
flesh of the wild goat;<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c012'><sup>[535]</sup></a> and from a passage in
the Iliad, Feith infers, that even birds were not
spared.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c012'><sup>[536]</sup></a> We trust, however, that they feathered
and cooked them, and did not devour them <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>au naturel</i></span>,
as certain Hindùs do their sheep, wool and
all. The Egyptians had a very peculiar taste in
ornithophagy, and actually ate some kinds of birds
quite raw, as they likewise did several species of
fish; and this not in those early ages when Isis
and Osiris had not reclaimed the bogs of the Nile,
but in times quite modern, when Herodotus travelled
in their country, and heard their vain priests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>lay claim to having civilised Hellas. Both birds
and fish, indeed, underwent a certain sort of preparation.
Of the latter some were dried in the sun,
others preserved in pickle, and the same process
was applied to ducks, quails, and many other species
of birds, after which they were eaten raw. We
recommend the practice to our gourmands, and have
no doubt they would find a pickled owl or jackdaw,
devoured in the Egyptian style, altogether as wholesome
as diseased goose’s liver. It must not, however,
be dissembled, that many critics, concerned
for the gastronomic reputation of the Egyptians,
contend that, by the word which we translate “to
pickle,”<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c012'><sup>[537]</sup></a> Herodotus must have meant some kind
of cookery; to which Wesseling replies, that, without
designing to impugn the taste of those gentlemen,
he must yet refuse to accept of their interpretation,
since by observing that they roasted or
boiled all other species of birds and fish, such as
were sacred excepted, the historian evidently intends
to say, that these were eaten raw. The
learned editor might have added, that Herodotus
uses the same term in treating of the process of
embalming,<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c012'><sup>[538]</sup></a> and we nowhere learn that the mummies
were cooked before they were deposited in
the tombs.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to return to the Homeric warriors; it seems
extremely<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c012'><sup>[539]</sup></a> probable, notwithstanding the opinions
of several writers of great authority, both ancient
and modern, that the demi-gods, and heroes before
Troy, admitted that effeminate dainty called <em>fish</em>
to their warlike tables. At all events the common
people understood the value of this kind of
food,<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c012'><sup>[540]</sup></a> and it may safely be inferred that their betters,
never slow in appropriating delicacies to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>own use, soon perceived that fish is no bad eating.
Hunger would at least reconcile them to the flavour
of broiled salmon, as we find by the example of
Odysseus’s companions, who devoured both fish and
fowl.<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c012'><sup>[541]</sup></a> This is acknowledged by Athenæus;<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c012'><sup>[542]</sup></a> but
Plutarch contends, that they could have been driven
to it only by extreme necessity. At all
other times he imagines they temperately abstained
from food of so exciting a kind,<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c012'><sup>[543]</sup></a> though Homer
describes the Hellespont as abounding in fish,<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c012'><sup>[544]</sup></a> and
more than once alludes to the practice of drawing
it thence with hook and line.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c012'><sup>[545]</sup></a> Thus we find that
angling can trace back its pedigree to the heroic
ages; and the disciple of the rod as he trudges
with Izaak in his pocket through bog and mire in
search of a good bite, may solace his imagination
with reminiscences of Troy and the Hellespont. But
the good people of those days did not wholly rely
for a supply of fish on this very tedious and inefficient
process; they had discovered the use of nets,
which Homer describes the fisherman casting on
the sea shore.<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c012'><sup>[546]</sup></a> Though the poet, however, had
omitted all allusion to this kind of food, its use
might, nevertheless, have been confidently inferred,
as may that of milk, common to all nations, though
Homer mentions it only, I believe, in the case of
the Hippomolgians,<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c012'><sup>[547]</sup></a> and the cannibal Polyphemus,
who understood also the luxury of cheese.<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c012'><sup>[548]</sup></a> Circe,
too, who being a goddess may be supposed to have
been a connoisseur in dainties, presents her paramour
Odysseus with a curious mixture, consisting
of cheese, honey, flour, and wine,<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c012'><sup>[549]</sup></a> very savoury, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>doubt, and by old Nestor considered of salutary nature,
since Hecamedè, at his order, prepares a plentiful
supply of it for the wounded Machaon. Along with
this posset, garlic was eaten as a relish.<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c012'><sup>[550]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Fruits and potherbs, as may be supposed, were
already in use.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c012'><sup>[551]</sup></a> Garlic we have mentioned above;
and Odysseus, after all his wars and wanderings,
<a id='corr133.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='recals'>recalls</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_133.8'><ins class='correction' title='recals'>recalls</ins></a></span> to mind with a quite natural pleasure the
apple and pear trees which his father, Laertes, had
given him when a boy.<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c012'><sup>[552]</sup></a> Alcinoös possessed a fine
orchard, where, though the process of grafting is
supposed to have been then unknown, we find a
variety of beautiful fruits, as pears, apples, pomegranates,
delicious figs, olives, and grapes; and in
his kitchen-garden were all kinds of vegetables.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c012'><sup>[553]</sup></a>
And the shadowy boughs of a similar orchard, covered
with golden fruit, wave over Tantalos in
Hades, but are blown back by the wind whenever
the wretched old sinner stretches forth his hand
towards them.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c012'><sup>[554]</sup></a> From this circumstance Athenæus,
with much ingenuity, infers that fruit was actually
in use before the Trojan war! Apples seem then,
as now, to have constituted a favourite portion of
the dessert, though among the Homeric warriors they
seem sometimes to have formed a principal part of
the meal; for Servius<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c012'><sup>[555]</sup></a> describes the primitive repasts
as consisting of two courses, of which the first
was animal food, and apples the second.</p>

<p class='c001'>Salt was in great use in the Homeric age, and by
the poet sometimes called divine.<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c012'><sup>[556]</sup></a> Plato, also, in the
Timæos,<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c012'><sup>[557]</sup></a> speaks of salt as a thing acceptable to the
gods, an expression which Plutarch quotes with manifest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>approbation in a passage where he grows quite
eloquent in praise of this article, which he denominates
the condiment of condiments, adding, that of
some it was numbered among the Graces.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c012'><sup>[558]</sup></a> By the
most ancient Greeks salt was, for this reason, always
spoken of in conjunction with the table, as in the old
proverb, where men were advised “never to pass by salt
or a table,” that is, not to neglect a good dinner.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c012'><sup>[559]</sup></a> Poor
men, who probably had no other seasoning for their
food, were contemptuously denominated “salt-lickers.”<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c012'><sup>[560]</sup></a>
But, in Homer’s time, there existed certain Hellenic
tribes who had not yet arrived at a knowledge of this
luxury; among whom, accordingly, even the most aristocratic
personages were compelled to go without salt
to their porridge.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c012'><sup>[561]</sup></a> The poet has, indeed, omitted to
mention their names; but Pausanias supposes him to
have alluded to the more inland clans of Epeirots,
many of which had not yet, in those ages, acquired
a knowledge of salt, or even of the sea.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c012'><sup>[562]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It appears to be agreed on all hands, that the primitive
races of men were mere water-drinkers. Accordingly
they had neither poets nor inn-keepers, nor
excisemen,—three classes of persons who never flourish
but where wine, or at least beer, is found.
Homer more than once alludes to this vicious habit
of the old world, where, with a sly insinuation of
contempt,—for he was himself partial to the blood-red
wine,—he tells us that this or that nation drank,
like so many oxen or crocodiles, of the waters of
such or such a river. Thus, when enumerating the
allies of Ilion, he describes the Zeleians as those who
sipped the black waters of the Æsepos.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c012'><sup>[563]</sup></a> Pindar, too,
in the hope of obtaining a reputation for sobriety,
says, he was accustomed to drink the waters of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Thebes, which, in his opinion, were very delicious,<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c012'><sup>[564]</sup></a>
though Hippocrates would unquestionably have been
of a totally different way of thinking. The Persian,
and afterwards the Parthian kings, appear in many
cases to have entertained a temperate predilection
for the water of certain streams, of which Milton
has given eternal celebrity to one:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Choaspes, amber stream,</div>
      <div class='line'>The drink of none but kings.”<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c012'><sup>[565]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But evidently through mistake; for though historians
pretend that the Parthian monarchs would drink of
no water save that of the Choaspes, to which Pliny<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c012'><sup>[566]</sup></a>
adds the Eulæus, it is by no means said that they
enjoyed a monopoly of those streams. Perhaps our
great poet confounded the Choaspes with those Golden
Waters which, in Athenæus, are said to have
been wholly reserved for the use of the king and
his eldest son.<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c012'><sup>[567]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Wine, however, was invented very early in the
history of the world; and the virtue of sobriety was
born along with it; for, until then, it had been no
merit to be sober. With whomsoever its use began,
wine was well known to Homer’s heroes, one of whom
speaks of it, in conjunction with bread, as the chief
root of man’s strength and vigour.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c012'><sup>[568]</sup></a> Yet the warriors
of those ages by no means exhibited that selfish parsimony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>which led the Romans to debar their matrons
the use of wine.<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c012'><sup>[569]</sup></a> In Homer we find women, even
while very young, permitted the enjoyment of it:
for example, Nausicaa and her companions, who, in
setting forth on their washing excursion, are furnished
by the queen herself with a plentiful supply
of provisions, and a skin of wine.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c012'><sup>[570]</sup></a> Boys, likewise,
in the heroic ages, met with similar indulgence; for
Phœnix is represented permitting Achilles to join
him in his potations before the little urchin knew
how to drink without spilling it over himself.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c012'><sup>[571]</sup></a> This
practice, however, is very properly condemned by
Plato, who considered that no person under eighteen
should be allowed to taste of wine, and even then
but sparingly.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c012'><sup>[572]</sup></a> After thirty, more discretion might,
he thought, be granted them; though he recommended
sobriety at all times, save, perhaps, on the anniversary
festival of Dionysos, and certain other divinities, when
a merry bowl was judged in keeping with the other
ceremonies of the day.<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c012'><sup>[573]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We shall now pass from the primitive aliments of
the heroic times to those almost infinite varieties of
good things which the ingenuity of later ages brought
into use. The reader, not already familiar with the
gastronomic fragments of ancient literature, will probably
be surprised at the omniverous character of
the Greeks, to whom nothing seems to have come
amiss, from the nettle-top to the peach, from the
sow’s metra to the most delicate bird, from the shark
to the small semi-transparent aphyæ, caught along
the shores of Attica.<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c012'><sup>[574]</sup></a> Through this ocean of dainties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>we shall endeavour to make our way on the following
plan:—first, it will be our “hint to speak”
of the more solid kinds of food, as beef, mutton, pork,
veal; we shall then make a transition to the soups,
fowls, and fish; next the fruit will claim our attention;
and, lastly, the several varieties of wines.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has already been observed, that in the earliest
ages men wholly abstained from animal food.<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c012'><sup>[575]</sup></a> Afterwards
when they began to cast “wolfish eyes” upon
their mute companions on the globe, the hog is said
to have been the first creature whose character emboldened
them to make free with him. They saw
it endued with less intelligence than other animals;
and, from its stupidity, inferred that it ought to be
eaten, its soul merely serving during life, as salt, to
keep the flesh from putrefying.<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c012'><sup>[576]</sup></a> The determining
reason, however, appears to have been, that they
could make no other use of him, since he would
neither plough like the ox, nor be saddled and mounted
like the horse or ass, nor become a pleasant companion,
or guard the house, like the dog.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was long before men in any country slew the
ox for food; his great utility was his protection,
and in some parts of the East the well-meaning
priesthood at length compassed him round with the
armour of superstition, which outlasted the occasion,
and in India has come down in nearly all its
strength to our own day. It was otherwise in
Greece. There common sense quickly dissipated
the illusion, which, while it was necessary, had
guarded the ox, and beef became the favourite food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of its hardy and active inhabitants, who likewise
fed indiscriminately on sheep, goats, deer, hares,
and almost every other animal, wild or tame.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been seen that in remote ages fish did
not constitute any great part of the sustenance of
the Greeks. But public opinion afterwards underwent
a very considerable change. From having
been held in so little estimation as to be left
chiefly to the use of the poor, in the historical
ages it became their greatest luxury.<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c012'><sup>[577]</sup></a> And there
arose among gourmands, those ancient St. Simonians,
whose god was their belly, a kind of enthusiastic
rivalry as to who should be first in the
morning at the fish-market, and bear away, as in
triumph, the largest Copaic eels, the finest pair of
soles, or the freshest <em>anthias</em>.<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c012'><sup>[578]</sup></a> On this subject,
therefore, our details must be somewhat more elaborate
than on beef and mutton. And first, we
shall take the reader along with us to the market,
whither it will be advisable that he carry as little
money as possible, since, according to the comic
poets, your Athenian fishmonger, not content with
being a mere rogue, dealt a little also in the
assassin’s trade.<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c012'><sup>[579]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The first thing which a rich gourmand inquired
in the morning was, which way the wind blew.
If from the north, and there was anything like a
sea, he remained sullenly at home, for no fishing
smacks could in that case make the Peiræeus;<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c012'><sup>[580]</sup></a>
but if the wind sat in any other quarter, out he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>went eagerly and stealthily with a slave and basket<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c012'><sup>[581]</sup></a>
at his heels, casting about anxious looks to discover
whether any other impassioned fish-eater had got
the start of him on his way to the Agora, who
might clear the stalls of the best anthias or thunny
before he could reach the spot.</p>

<p class='c001'>The unmoneyed rogue, however, whose ambitious
taste soared to these expensive dainties, approached
the market with a rueful countenance. Thus we
find a poor fellow describing, in Antiphanes, his
morning’s pilgrimage in search of a pair of soles:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I once believed the Gorgons fabulous:</div>
      <div class='line'>But in the agora quickly changed my creed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And turned almost to stone, the pests beholding</div>
      <div class='line'>Standing behind the fish stalls. Forced I am</div>
      <div class='line'>To look another way when I accost them,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest if I saw the fish they ask so much for,</div>
      <div class='line'>I should at once grow marble.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c012'><sup>[582]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Amphis, another comic poet, supplies us with
further details respecting the hardships encountered
by those who had to deal with fishmongers at
Athens. Much of his wit is, I fear, intransferable,
depending in a great measure on the vernacular clipping
of Greek common in the market-place. But
the sense, at least, may perhaps be given:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ten thousand times more easy ’tis to gain</div>
      <div class='line'>Admission to a haughty general’s tent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And have discourse of him, than in the market</div>
      <div class='line'>Audience to get of a cursed fishmonger.</div>
      <div class='line'>If you draw near and say, How much<a id='corr139.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title=' my,'>, my</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_139.30'><ins class='correction' title=' my,'>, my</ins></a></span> friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Costs <em>this</em> or <em>that</em>?—No answer. Deaf you think</div>
      <div class='line'>The rogue must be, or stupid; for he heeds not</div>
      <div class='line'>A syllable you say, but o’er his fish</div>
      <div class='line'>Bends silently like Telephos (and with good reason,</div>
      <div class='line'>For his whole race he knows are cut-throats all).</div>
      <div class='line'>Another minding not, or else not hearing,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Pulls by the legs a polypus.<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c012'><sup>[583]</sup></a> A third</div>
      <div class='line'>With saucy carelessness replies, ‘Four oboli,</div>
      <div class='line'>That’s just the price. For this no less than eight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Take it or leave it!’”<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c012'><sup>[584]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Alexis, too, that most comic of comic writers,
seems to have imagined, that the humour of his
pieces would be incomplete without a spice of the
fishmonger. Commencing, like Amphis, with an
allusion to the haughty airs of military men, he
glides into his subject as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>However, this is still endurable.</div>
      <div class='line'>But when a paltry fishfag will look big,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cast down his eyes affectedly, or bend</div>
      <div class='line'>His eyebrows upwards like a fullstrained bow,</div>
      <div class='line'>I burst with rage. Demand what price he asks</div>
      <div class='line'>For—say two mullets; and he answers straight</div>
      <div class='line'>“Ten obols”—“Ten? That’s dear: will you take eight?”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Yes, if one fish will serve you.”—“Friend, no jokes;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am no subject for your mirth.”—“Pass on, Sir!</div>
      <div class='line'>And buy elsewhere.”—Now tell me is not this</div>
      <div class='line'>Bitterer than gall?<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c012'><sup>[585]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But if the reader should be disposed to infer from
these testimonies that the fishmongering race were
saucy only at Athens, he will be in danger of falling
into error. Throughout the ancient world they
were the same, and we fear that should any poor
devil from Grub-street, or the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Quartier Latin</i></span>, presume
to dispute respecting the price of salmon with
one of their cockney or Parisian descendants, he
would meet with little more politeness. At all
events their manners had not improved in the Eternal
city,<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c012'><sup>[586]</sup></a> for it is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>a propos</i></span> of the Roman fishfags
that Athenæus brings forward his examples of like
insolence elsewhere. The poet Diphilos would appear,
like Archestratos, to have travelled in search
of good fish and civil fishmongers, but his labours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>were fruitless; he might as well have peregrinated
the world in the hope of finding that island where
soles are caught ready-fried in the sea. Such at
least is the tenour of his own complaint:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Troth, in my greener days I had some notion</div>
      <div class='line'>That here at Athens only, rogues sold fish;</div>
      <div class='line'>But everywhere, it seems, like wolf or fox,</div>
      <div class='line'>The race is treacherous by nature found.</div>
      <div class='line'>However, we have one scamp in the agora</div>
      <div class='line'>Who beats all others hollow. On his head</div>
      <div class='line'>A most portentous fell of hair nods thick</div>
      <div class='line'>And shades his brow. Observing your surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>He has his reasons pat; it grows forsooth</div>
      <div class='line'>To form, when shorn, an offering to some god!</div>
      <div class='line'>But that’s a feint, ’tis but to hide the scars</div>
      <div class='line'>Left by the branding iron upon his forehead.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, passing that, you ask perchance the price</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a sea-wolf—“Ten oboli”—very good.</div>
      <div class='line'>You count the money. “Oh not those,” he cries,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Æginetan I meant.” Still you comply.</div>
      <div class='line'>But if you trust him with a larger piece,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there be change to give; mark how the knave</div>
      <div class='line'>Now counts in Attic coin, and thus achieves</div>
      <div class='line'>A two-fold robbery in the same transaction!<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c012'><sup>[587]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Xenarchos paints a little scene of ingenious roguery
with a comic extravagance altogether Shakespearian,
and incidentally throws light on a curious law of
Athens, enacted to protect the citizens against stinking
fish.<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c012'><sup>[588]</sup></a> The power of invention, he observes—willing
to kill two birds with one stone—had totally
deserted the poets in order to take up with
the fishmongers; for while the former merely hashed
up old ideas, the latter were always hitting upon
new contrivances to poison the Demos:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Commend me for invention to the rogue</div>
      <div class='line'>Who sells fish in the agora. He knows</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>In fact there’s no mistaking,—that the law</div>
      <div class='line'>Clearly and formally forbids the trick</div>
      <div class='line'>Of reconciling stale fish to the nose</div>
      <div class='line'>By constant watering. But if some poor wight</div>
      <div class='line'>Detect him in the fact, forthwith he picks</div>
      <div class='line'>A quarrel, and provokes his man to blows.</div>
      <div class='line'>He wheels meanwhile about his fish, looks sharp</div>
      <div class='line'>To catch the nick of time, reels, feigns a hurt:</div>
      <div class='line'>And prostrate falls, just in the right position.</div>
      <div class='line'>A friend placed there on purpose, snatches up</div>
      <div class='line'>A pot of water, sprinkles a drop or two,</div>
      <div class='line'>For form’s sake on his face, but by mistake,</div>
      <div class='line'>As you must sure believe, pours all the rest</div>
      <div class='line'>Full on the fish, so that almost you might</div>
      <div class='line'>Consider them fresh caught.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c012'><sup>[589]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>By a law passed at the instance of the wealthy
Aristonicos, himself no doubt an ichthyophagos, the
penalty of imprisonment was decreed against all
those who, having named a price for their fish,
should take less, in order that they might at once
demand what was just and no more. In consequence
of this enactment, an old woman or a child
might be sent to the fish-market, without danger
of being cheated. According to another provision
of this Golden Law, as it is termed by Alexis, fishmongers
were compelled to stand at their stalls and
not to sit as had previously been the custom. The
comic poet, in the fulness of his charity, expresses
a hope that they might be all <em>suspended</em> aloft on
the following year, by which means, he says, they
would get a quicker sight of their customers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>carry on their dealings with mankind from a machine
like the gods of tragedy.<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c012'><sup>[590]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In consequence no doubt of the perpetually increasing
demand, fish was extremely dear at Athens.
Accordingly Diphilos, addressing himself to Poseidon,
who, as god of the sea, was god also of its
inhabitants, informs him that, could he but secure
the tithe of fish, he would soon become the wealthiest
divinity in Olympos. Among those who distinguished
themselves in this business in the agora,
and apparently became rich, it is probable that many
were metoiki, such as Hermæos, the Egyptian, and
Mikion, who, though his country is not mentioned,
was probably not an Athenian. In proportion as
they grew opulent, the gourmands on whom they
preyed became poor, and doubtless there was too
much truth in the satire which represented men
dissipating their whole fortunes in the frying-pan.
There were those also it seems who spent their evenings
on the highway, in order to furnish their daily
table with such dainties. For this fact we have the
satisfactory testimony of Alexis in his Heiress:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mark you a fellow who, however scant</div>
      <div class='line'>In all things else, hath still wherewith to purchase</div>
      <div class='line'>Cod, eel, or anchovies, be sure i’ the dark</div>
      <div class='line'>He lies about the road in wait for travellers.</div>
      <div class='line'>If therefore you’ve been robbed o’ernight, just go</div>
      <div class='line'>At peep of dawn to th’ agora and seize</div>
      <div class='line'>The first athletic, ragged vagabond</div>
      <div class='line'>Who cheapens eels of Mikion. He, be sure,</div>
      <div class='line'>And none but he’s the thief: to prison with him!<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c012'><sup>[591]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>They had at Corinth a pretty strict police regulation
on this subject. When any person was observed
habitually to purchase fish, he was interrogated
by the authorities respecting his means. If
found to be a man of property they suffered him
to do what he pleased with his own; but, in the
contrary event, he received a gentle hint that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>state had its eye upon him. The neglect of this
admonition was followed, in the first place, by a fine,
and ultimately, if persevered in, by a punishment
equivalent to the treadmill.<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c012'><sup>[592]</sup></a> These matters were in
Athens submitted to the cognizance of two or three
magistrates, called Opsonomoi, nominated by the Senate.<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c012'><sup>[593]</sup></a>
With respect to the purchase of this class
of viands, everywhere attended with peculiar difficulties,
it may be said, that the ancients had considerably
the advantage of us; since in Lynceus of
Samos’s “Fish-buyer’s Manual,” they possessed a sure
guide through all the intricacies of bargaining in the
agora.</p>

<p class='c001'>But before we proceed further with this part of
our subject, we will demand permission of Lynceus
to hear what Hesiod has to say of saltfish, on
which Euthydemos, the Athenian, composed a separate
treatise. According to this poet, who boldly
speaks of cities erected long after his death, immense
quantities of fish were salted on the Bosporos,
sometimes entire, as in modern times,<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c012'><sup>[594]</sup></a> sometimes
cut into gobbets of a moderate size. Among
these were the oxyrinchos whose taste proved often
fatal, the thunny, and the mackerel. The little city
of Parion furnished the best kolias (a kind of mackerel),
and the Tarentine merchants brought to Athens
pickled orcynos from Cadiz, cut into small triangular
pieces, in jars.<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c012'><sup>[595]</sup></a> Physicians, indeed, inveighed
against these relishes; but the gourmands would consult
only their palates and preferred a short life with
pickled thunny to that of Saturn himself on beef
and mutton.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Hesiod of Euthydemos (a creation probably
of his own) is but very poor authority compared
with Archestratos, who made the pilgrimage
of the world in search of good cheer, and afterwards,
for the benefit of posterity, treasured up his experience
in a grand culinary epic. In his opinion a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>slice of Sicilian thunny was a rare delicacy, while
the saperda, though brought from the Pontos Euxinos,
he held as cheap as those who boasted of it.<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c012'><sup>[596]</sup></a>
The scombros, by some supposed to be a species of
thunny, though others understand by it the common
mackerel, stood high in the estimation of this connoisseur.
He directs that it be left in salt three
days, and eaten before it begins to melt into brine.<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c012'><sup>[597]</sup></a>
In his estimation the horaion<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c012'><sup>[598]</sup></a> of Byzantium was
likewise a great delicacy, which he advises the traveller,
who might pass through that city, to taste
by all means. It seems to have been there what
macaroni is at Naples.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alexis, in one of his comedies, introduces the Symposiarch
of an Eranos (president of a picnic) accounting
with one of the subscribers who comes to demand
back his ring, and in the course of the dialogue,
where something like Falstaff’s tavern-bill is
discussed, we find the prices of several kinds of salt-fish.
An omotarichos (shoulder piece of thunny) is
charged at five chalci; a dish of sea-mussels, seven
chalci, of sea-urchins, an obol, a slice of kybion,
three obols, a conger eel, ten, and another plate of
broiled fish, a drachma. This comic writer<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c012'><sup>[599]</sup></a> rates
the fish of the Nile very low, and he is quite right,
for they are generally muddy and ill-tasted, though
the Copts, who have considerable experience during
Lent, contrive, by the application of much Archestratic
skill, to render some kinds of them palatable.
Sophocles, in a fragment of his lost drama of Phineus,
speaks of salt-fish embalmed like an Egyptian
mummy.<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c012'><sup>[600]</sup></a> Stock-fish, as I know to my cost,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>is still a fashionable dish in the Mediterranean, especially
on board ship, and from a proverb preserved
by Athenæus we find it was likewise in use among
the Athenians.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c012'><sup>[601]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The passion of this refined people for salt-fish furnished
them with an occasion of showing their gratitude
publicly. They bestowed the rights of citizenship
on the sons of Chæriphilos, a metoikos who
first introduced among them a knowledge of this sort
of food.<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c012'><sup>[602]</sup></a> A similar feeling prompted the Dutch to
erect a statue to G. Bukel, the man who taught
them to salt herrings.<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c012'><sup>[603]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Without enumerating a tenth part of the other
species eaten among the Greeks, we pass to the shell-fish,
of which they were likewise great amateurs.
Epicharmos, in his marriage of Hebe, supplies a curious
list, which, however, might be extended almost
ad infinitum. Among these were immense limpets,
the buccinum, the cecibalos, the tethynakion, the
sea-acorn, the purple fish, oysters hard to open but
easy to swallow, mussels, sea-snails or periwinkles,
skiphydria sweet to taste but prickly to touch, large
shelled razor-fish, the black conch, and the amathitis.
The conch was also called tellinè as the same
poet in his Muses observes. Alcæos wrote a song
to the limpet beginning with</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Child of the rock and hoary sea.”<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c012'><sup>[604]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boys used to make a sort of whistle of tortoise
and mussel shells. These mussels were usually
broiled on the coals, and Aristophanes, very ingenious
in his similes, compares a gaping silly fellow
to a mussel in the act of being cooked.<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c012'><sup>[605]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Like the sepia, of which excellent pilaus are made
at Alexandria, the porphyra or purple fish was very

<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>was boiled.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c012'><sup>[606]</sup></a> There was a small delicate shell-fish
caught on the island of Pharos and adjacent coasts
of Egypt, which they called Aphrodite’s ear,<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c012'><sup>[607]</sup></a> and
there is still found on the same coast near Canopos
a diminutive and beautiful rose-coloured conch
called Venus’s nipple. On the same shore, about
the rise of the Nile, that species of mussel called
tellinè was caught in great abundance, but the best-tasted
were said to be found in the river itself. A
still finer kind were in season about autumn in the
vicinity of Ephesos. The echinos, or sea-chestnut,<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c012'><sup>[608]</sup></a>
cooked with oxymel, parsley, and mint, was esteemed
good and wholesome eating. Those caught about
Cephalonia, Icaria, and Achaia were bitterish, those
of Sicily laxative; the best were the red and the
quince coloured. A laughable anecdote is told of
a Spartan, who being invited to dine where sea-chestnuts
were brought to table, took one upon his plate,
and not knowing how they were eaten put it into
his mouth, shell and all. Finding it exceedingly
unmanageable, he turned it about for some time,
seeking slowly and cautiously to discover the knack
of eating it. But the rough and prickly shell still
resisting his efforts, his temper grew ruffled: crunching
it fiercely he exclaimed, “Detestable beast!
Well! I will not let thee go now, after having
thus ground thee to pieces; but assuredly I will
never touch thee again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Oysters were esteemed good when boiled with

Perizonius in his note on this
passage observes, that ἄπιος and
ἀχράς are but different names
for the same thing, both signifying
“the pear,” the former term
prevailing among the Argives, the
latter among the Tirynthians and
Laconians. By the other Greeks
both words were used promiscuously,
though ἄπιος was the more
common. This able commentator
objects to the assertion of his
author, that the Hindoos lived on
cane, since they also ate millet,
rice, &amp;c. But Ælian could really
have intended nothing more
than that the articles he enumerates
were in common use among
the nations spoken of. Otherwise
the whole must be regarded as a
mere fable. The canes, mentioned
by Ælian, are those from
which sugar has been from very

<p class='c011'>The reader by this time will, probably, be willing
to escape from fish, though it would be easy
to treat him to many new kinds, and along with
us take a slice of Greek pheasant, or the breast
of an Egyptian quail. In other words, he will
hear what we have to say on Hellenic poultry.
Chrysippos, in his treatise on things desirable in
themselves, appears to have reckoned Athenian cocks
and hens among the number, and reprehends the
people of Attica for importing, at great expense,
barn-door fowls from the shores of the Adriatic,
though of smaller size, and much inferior to their
own; while the inhabitants of those countries, on
the other hand, were anxious to possess Attic poultry.<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c012'><sup>[621]</sup></a>
Matron, the parodist, who furnishes an amusing
description of an Athenian repast, observes,
that excellent wild ducks were brought to town
from Salamis, where they grew fat in great numbers
on the borders of the sacred Lake.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c012'><sup>[622]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The thrush,<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c012'><sup>[623]</sup></a> reckoned among the greatest delicacies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of the ancients, generally at grand entertainments
formed part of the propoma, or first
course, and was eaten with little cakes, called
ametiskoi. If we may credit Epicharmos, a decided
preference was given to such as fed on the
olive. Aristotle divides the thrush into three species,
the first and largest of which he denominates
Ixophagos, or the “mistletoe-eater;” it was of the
size of a magpie. The second, equal in bigness
to the black bird, he calls Trichas,<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c012'><sup>[624]</sup></a> and the third,
and smallest kind, which was named Ilas or Tulas,
according to Alexander, the Myndian, went in
flocks, and built its nest like the swallow.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c012'><sup>[625]</sup></a> Next
in excellence to the thrush was a bird known by
a variety of names, elaios, pirias, sycalis,<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c012'><sup>[626]</sup></a> the beccafico
of the moderns, which was thought to be
in season when the figs were ripe. They likewise
ate the turtle and the ringdove,<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c012'><sup>[627]</sup></a> which are excellent
in Egypt; the chaffinch, to whose qualities
I cannot bear testimony; and the blackbird. Nor
did they spare the starling, the jackdaw, or the
strouthanion, a small bird for which modern languages
cannot afford a name. Brains were thought
by the ancient philosophers an odious and cannibal-like
food, because they are the fountain of all
sensation; but this did not prevent the gourmands
from converting pigs’ brains into a dainty dish,<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c012'><sup>[628]</sup></a> and
their taste has maintained its ground in Italy. Partridges,
wood-pigeons, geese, quails, jays, are also
enumerated among the materials of an Hellenic
banquet.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Goose’s liver was in extreme request both at
Rome and Athens.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c012'><sup>[629]</sup></a> Another dainty was a cock
served up with a rich sauce, containing much vinegar.
Aristophanes speaks of the pheasant in his
comedy of the Birds; and, again, in the Clouds,
Athenæus rightly supposes him to mean this bird,
where others imagine he alludes to the horses of
the Phasis. Mnesilochos, a writer of the middle
comedy, classes a plucked pheasant with <em>hen’s milk</em>,
among things equally difficult to be met with, which
shows that the bird had not then become common.
It obtained its name from being found in immense
numbers about the embouchure of the Phasis, and
the bird was evidently propagated very slowly in
Greece and Egypt, since we find Ptolemy Philadelphos,
in a grand public festival at Alexandria, exhibiting
it, among other rarities, such as parroquets,
peacocks, guinea-fowl, and Ethiopian birds
in cages.<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c012'><sup>[630]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the favourite game of the Athenian gourmands
was the Attagas,<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c012'><sup>[631]</sup></a> or francolin, a little larger
than the partridge, variegated with numerous spots,
and of common tile colour, somewhat inclining to
red. It is said to have been introduced from Lydia
into Greece, and was found in extraordinary abundance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>in the Megaris. Another of their favourites
was the porphyrion, a bird which might with great
advantage be introduced into many countries of modern
Europe, since it was exceedingly domestic, and
kept strict watch over the married women, whose
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>faux pas</i></span> it immediately detected and revealed to
their husbands, after which, knowing the revengeful
spirit of ladies so situated, it very prudently hung
itself. It is no wonder, therefore, that the breed
has long been extinct, or that the remnant surviving
has taken refuge in some remote region, where wives
require no such vigilant guardians. In the matter
of eating it agreed exactly with Lord Byron, loving
to feast alone, and in retired nooks, where none
could observe. Aristotle describes this half fabulous
bird as unwebfooted, of blue colour, with long legs,
and red beak. The porphyrion was about the size
of a cock, and originally a native of Libya, where
it was esteemed sacred.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c012'><sup>[632]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another bird common in Greece, but now no
longer known, was the porphyris, by some confounded
with the foregoing. Of the partridge, common
throughout Europe, we need merely remark,
that both the gray and the red (the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bartavelle</i></span> of
the French) were common in Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we pass from the poultry to puddings and
soups,<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c012'><sup>[633]</sup></a> we shall find that the Athenians were not ill-provided
with these dainties. They even converted
gruel into a delicacy,<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c012'><sup>[634]</sup></a> and it is said, that the best
was made at Megara. They had bean soup, flour
soup, ptisans made with pearl-barley or groats.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c012'><sup>[635]</sup></a>
We hear, also, of a delicately-powdered dish or soup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>which was sprinkled over with fine flour and olives.
The polphos, evidently <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>soupe à la julienne</i></span>, is said,
by some, to have been composed of scraped roots,
vegetables, and flour. Others take it to mean a
sort of made-dish, resembling macaroni or vermicelli.
Another kind of soup was the <em>kidron</em>, which,
according to Pollux,<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c012'><sup>[636]</sup></a> they made of green wheat,
roasted and reduced to powder.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was one dish fashionable among the ancient
Greeks mistaken by our neighbours, the French,
for plum-pudding, which is still found in perfection
in the Levant, where I have many times eaten of
it. Julius Pollux<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c012'><sup>[637]</sup></a> has preserved the recipe for
making it, and we can assure our gourmands, that
nothing more exquisite was ever tasted, even in
the best café of the Palais Royal. They took a certain
quantity of the finest clarified lard, and, mixing
it up with milk until it was quite thick, added
an equal portion of new cheese, yolks of eggs, and
the finest flour. The whole rolled up tight in a
fragrant fig-leaf, was then cooked in chicken-broth,
or soup made with kid’s flesh. When they considered
it well done, the leaf was removed and the
pudding soused in boiling honey. It was then served
up hissing-hot. All the ingredients were used in
equal proportions, excepting the yolks of eggs, of
which there was somewhat more than of anything
else, in order to give firmness and consistency to
the whole.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c012'><sup>[638]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Black puddings, made with blood, suet, and the
other materials now used were also common at
Athens.<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c012'><sup>[639]</sup></a> Mushrooms and snails were great favourites;
and Poliochos speaks of going out in the
dewy mornings in search of these luxuries.<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c012'><sup>[640]</sup></a> In
spring, before the arrival of the swallow, the nettle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>was collected and eaten, it being then young and
tender.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c012'><sup>[641]</sup></a> Leeks, onions, garlic, were in much request,
the last particularly, which grew in great plenty
in the Megarean territory, and hence, perhaps, the
inhabitants were accounted hot and quarrelsome,
garlic being supposed to inspire game, even in
fighting cocks, to which it was accordingly given
in great quantities.<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c012'><sup>[642]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the herbs eaten by his countrymen, Hesiod
enumerates the mallow,<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c012'><sup>[643]</sup></a> and the asphodel, which
are likewise said by Aristophanes to have constituted
a great part of the food of the early Greeks. Gœttling,
therefore, not without reason, wonders that Pythagoras
should have prohibited the use of the mallow.
Lupines, pomegranates, horse-radish, the dregs
of grapes and olives, all of which entered into the
material of an Attic entertainment, were commonly
cried about the streets of Athens.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c012'><sup>[644]</sup></a> But these edible
lupines, (θέρμοι) still eaten by the Egyptian peasantry
and the poor generally throughout the Levant, must
be distinguished from the common species. An
anecdote of Zeno, of Cittion, will illustrate the
character of this kind of pulse, with which the
philosopher was evidently familiar. Being one day
asked why, though naturally morose, he became
quite affable when half-seas-over: “I am like the
lupine,” he replied, “which, when dry, is very bitter,
but perfectly sweet and agreeable after it has been
well soaked.”<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c012'><sup>[645]</sup></a> Kidney-beans, too, were in much
request, and pickled olives, slightly flavoured with
fennel.</p>

<p class='c001'>The radish<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c012'><sup>[646]</sup></a> was esteemed a great delicacy, particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>that of Thasos and Bœotia. And the seeds
of the ground-pine,<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c012'><sup>[647]</sup></a> still eaten as a dessert in Italy,
entered, in Greece, also into the list of edible fruits.<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c012'><sup>[648]</sup></a>
The tree, I am informed, has been introduced into
England, but I have nowhere seen its fruit brought
among pears, walnuts, and apples, to table. Hen’s
milk has already been spoken of among the good
things of Hellas;<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c012'><sup>[649]</sup></a> but lest the reader should suspect
us of amusing him with fables, it should be
explained, that the white of an egg was so called
by Anaxagoras.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c012'><sup>[650]</sup></a> Eggs of all kinds were much esteemed.
Sometimes they were boiled hard, and cut
in two with a hair; but, many writers, confounding
ὄα, the berries of the service-tree, with ὠὰ, eggs,
have imagined that the Athenians, in the capriciousness
of their culinary taste, actually ate pickled
eggs, an idea which stirs to the bottom the erudite
bile of David Ruhnken.<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c012'><sup>[651]</sup></a> Generally, eggs were eaten
soft, as with us, or swallowed quite raw. Those
of the pea-hen were considered the most delicate;
next to these, the eggs of the chenalopex bergander,
or Egyptian goose, and, lastly, those of the hen.
This, at least, is the opinion of Epicrates and Heracleides,

<p class='c001'>As when an entertainment was given the host necessarily
expected his guests to make a good dinner,
they usually commenced the business of the day with
an antecœnium or whet, consisting of herbs of the
sharpest taste. At Athens, the articles which generally
composed this course were colewort, eggs, oysters,
œnomel—a mixture of honey and wine—all supposed
to create appetite.<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c012'><sup>[653]</sup></a> To these even in later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>times were added the mallow and the asphodel,
king’s-spear or day-lily, gourds,<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c012'><sup>[654]</sup></a> melons, cucumbers.
The melons of Greece are still delicious, and famous
as ever in the Levant. Antioch was celebrated for
its cucumbers, Smyrna for its lettuces. Mushrooms
were always a favourite dish;<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c012'><sup>[655]</sup></a> and they had receipts
for producing them, which even now, perhaps, may
not be wholly unworthy of attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>The use, however, of this kind of food was always
attended with great danger, there being comparatively
few species that could be safely eaten. Persons
were frequently poisoned by them, and a pretty
epigram of Euripides has been preserved, commemorating
a mother and three children who had been
thus cut off, in the island of Icaros:</p>

<p class='c014'>Diodes, of Carystos, enumerates among wholesome
vegetables the red beet, the mallow, the dock, the
nettle, orach, the bolbos, or truffle, and the mushroom,
of which the best kinds were supposed to
grow at the foot of elm and pine trees.<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c012'><sup>[657]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The sion<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c012'><sup>[658]</sup></a> (sium latifolium), another of their vegetables,
is a plant found in marshes and meadows,
with the smallage.<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c012'><sup>[659]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another plant, of far greater celebrity, was the
Silphion,<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c012'><sup>[660]</sup></a> once extremely plentiful in Cyrenaica, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>also, though of an inferior quality, in Syria, Armenia,
and Media, but afterwards so rare as to be thought
extinct. Besides being used in seasoning soups and
sauces, and mixed with salt for giving a superior
flavour to meat, its juice occupied a high place among
the materia medica.<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c012'><sup>[661]</sup></a> A single plant was discovered
in the reign of Nero, and sent to Rome as a present
to the Emperor. Its seed, according to Pollux,<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c012'><sup>[662]</sup></a> was
called magudaris, its root silphion, the stem caulos,
and the leaf maspeton. Be this as it may, it communicated
to the sauces in which it was infused a
pungent and somewhat bitter taste, and was in no
favour with Archestratos.<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c012'><sup>[663]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We come now to the fruit,<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c012'><sup>[664]</sup></a> and shall begin with
that which was the pride of Attica, the fig.<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c012'><sup>[665]</sup></a> According
to traditions fully credited in Athens, figs were first
produced on a spot near the city, on the road to Eleusis,
thence called <em>Hiera Sukè</em>, “the sacred fig-tree.”<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c012'><sup>[666]</sup></a>
Like its men, the figs of Attica were esteemed the
best in the world, and to secure an abundant supply
for the use of the inhabitants it was forbidden to export
them. As might have been expected, however,
this decree was habitually contravened, and the informers
against the delinquents were called sycophants,
that is, “revealers of figs,”<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c012'><sup>[667]</sup></a> a word which has
been adopted by most modern languages to signify
mean-souled, dastardly persons, such as informers always
are. The fig-tree of Laconia was a dwarfed
species, and its fruit, according to Aristophanes,<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c012'><sup>[668]</sup></a> savoured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of hatred and tyranny, like the people themselves.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>There is no kind of fig,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Aristophanes, in Athenæus, speaking of fruit, couples
myrtle-berries with Phibaleian figs.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c012'><sup>[670]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>According to the ancients, there were certain sorts
of fig-trees that bore twice, thrice, and even four times,
in the year. Sosibios, the Laconian, attributing the
discovery of the fig to Bacchos, observes, that for this
reason the god was, at Sparta, worshiped under the
name of <em>Sukites</em>. Andriscos, however, and Agasthenes,
relate that this divinity obtained the name of
Meilichios, “the gracious,” among the Naxians because
he taught them the use of figs. To eat figs
at noon was regarded as unwholesome; and they were
at all times supposed to be highly prejudicial to the
voice, for which reason singers should carefully eschew
them.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c012'><sup>[671]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The apples of Delphi enjoyed great celebrity, and
probably, therefore, were mild, since these were thought
superior, or at least more wholesome, than sharp ones.
Quinces they esteemed still more salubrious than apples,
and, during certain public rejoicings, this fruit,
handfuls of myrtle-leaves, crowns of roses and violets,
were cast before the cars of their princes and other
great men.<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c012'><sup>[672]</sup></a> The Greeks loved to connect something
of the marvellous with whatever they admired. To
the quince they attributed the honour of being a
powerful antidote, observing that even the Phariac
poison, though of extremely rapid operation, lost its
virulence if poured into any vessel which had held
quinces and retained their odour.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c012'><sup>[673]</sup></a> According to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Hermon, in his Cretic Glossaries, the quince was called
Kodumala, in Crete. Sidoüs, a village of Corinthia,
was famous for its fine apples; and even Corinth
itself, the “windy Ephyrè” of Homer, produced them
in great perfection.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Another favourite fruit was the peach, introduced
from Persia into Greece.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c012'><sup>[675]</sup></a> The citron, too, though
supposed by some not to have been known to the
ancient inhabitants of Hellas, perfumed in later
ages the tables of the Greeks with its delicious
fragrance. This is the fruit which, according to
King Juba, was called in Africa “the apple of the
Hesperides,” a name bestowed by Timachidas on
a rich and fragrant kind of pear called <em>epimelis</em>.
The oldest Greek writer who has described the citron
tree is Theophrastus,<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c012'><sup>[676]</sup></a> who says it was found
in Persia and Media. Its leaf, he observes, resembled
that of the laurel, the strawberry tree, or
the walnut. Like the wild pear tree, and the oxyacanthos,
it has sharp, smooth, and very strong
prickles. The fruit is not eaten, but together with
the leaves exhales a sweet odour, and laid with
cloths in coffers protects them from the moth. The
citron tree, is always covered with fruit, some ripe
and fit to be gathered, others green, with patches
of gold; and, in the midst of these, are other
branches covered thick with blossoms. It now
forms the fairest ornaments of the gardens of Heliopolis,
where it shades the Fountain of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Antiphanes observes, in his B&oelig;otian, that it had

<p class='c014'>Athenæus, after quoting the testimony of poets,
relates a curious anecdote <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span> of citrons,
which I shall here repeat: it has, probably, some
reference to the secret of the Psylli. An opinion,
it seems, prevailed in Egypt, that a citron eaten
the first thing in the morning was an antidote
against all kinds of poison, whether taken into the
stomach, or introduced by puncture into the blood,
and the notion arose out of the following circumstance.
A governor of Egypt, in the time of the
Emperors, had condemned two criminals to be executed,
in obedience to custom, by the bite of an
asp. They were, accordingly, led in the morning
towards the place of execution, and on the way
the landlady of an inn, who happened to be eating
citrons, compassionating their condition, gave them
some which they ate. Shortly afterwards they
were exposed to the hungry serpents, which immediately
bit them, but instead of exhibiting the
usual symptoms followed by death, they remained
uninjured. At this the governor marvelled much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>and at length demanded of the soldier who guarded
them, whether they had taken anything previously
to their arrival. Learning what had happened
he put off the execution to the following day, and
ordering a citron to be given to one and not
to the other, they were once more exposed to the
bite of the asp. The wretch who had eaten nothing
died soon after he was bitten, but the other
experienced no inconvenience. Similar experiments
were several times afterwards made by others, until
it was at length ascertained that this exquisite
fruit is really an antidote against poisons.<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c012'><sup>[678]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another fruit of which great use was made, was
the damascene plum, sometimes confounded with
the brabylon. The cherry,<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c012'><sup>[679]</sup></a> introduced into Italy
by Lucullus, was known to the Greeks<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c012'><sup>[680]</sup></a> at a much
earlier period, and is described by Theophrastus.
The wild service berry,<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c012'><sup>[681]</sup></a> the dwarf cherry, the arbutus
fruit, and the mulberry, formed part of their
dessert. Even the blackberry, when perfectly ripe,
was not disdained.<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c012'><sup>[682]</sup></a> In fact, both the mulberry
and blackberry were esteemed a preventive of gout,
and an ancient writer relates, that this kind of
fruit having failed during a period of twenty years,
that disease prevailed like an epidemic, attacking
persons of both sexes and all ages, and extending
its ravages even to the sheep and cattle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Filberts, walnuts, and almonds,<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c012'><sup>[683]</sup></a> deservedly held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>a high place in the estimation of the ancients. Of
almonds, the island of Naxos had the reputation of
producing very excellent ones, and those of Cypros
also enjoyed considerable reputation. These latter
were longer in form than the former; like pickled
olives they were eaten at the commencement of a
repast, for the purpose of producing thirst; and
bitter almonds were considered a preservative against
intoxication, as we learn from an anecdote of Tiberius’s
physician, who could encounter three bottles
when thus fortified, but easily succumbed if deprived
of his almonds. This fruit being extremely
common in Greece, they had their almond-crackers,
as we have our nut-crackers, which at Sparta were
called <em>moucerobatos</em> but <em>amygdalocatactes</em> in the rest
of Greece.<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c012'><sup>[684]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The larger kind of chestnut, sometimes denominated
the “acorns of Zeus,” appears to have been
introduced into Greece from the countries round the
Pontos Euxinos, where they were produced in
great abundance, particularly in the environs of Heraclea.
There was, likewise, a sort of chestnut imported
from Persia, and another from the neighbourhood
of Sardes, in Lydia. Both these and the
walnut were considered indigestible; but not so the
almond, of which it was thought great quantities
might be eaten with impunity.<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c012'><sup>[685]</sup></a> The best kinds
were produced in Thasos and Cypros, and, when
freshly gathered, the almonds of the south are, undoubtedly,
of all fruit, the most delicate. The
walnuts <a id='corr163.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='aud'>and</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_163.31'><ins class='correction' title='aud'>and</ins></a></span> chestnuts of Eub&oelig;a, in the opinion
of Mnestheos, were difficult of digestion, but fattening;
and no one can have frequented the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean without observing what
an important article of food, and how nourishing,
they are.<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c012'><sup>[686]</sup></a> The pistachio nut, produced from a tree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>resembling the almond-tree, was imported from Syria
and Arabia.<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c012'><sup>[687]</sup></a> The <em>persea</em>, now no longer known,
but supposed to be represented on the walls of the
Memnonium,<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c012'><sup>[688]</sup></a> at Thebes, is, also, said, by Poseidonios,
the stoic, to have grown in Arabia and Syria,
and I brought home a quantity of leaves, preserved
in an Egyptian coffin, which are, probably, those
of this tree. Pears, which were brought to table
floating in water,<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c012'><sup>[689]</sup></a> and service-berries, were grown
in great perfection in the island of Ceos, and B&oelig;otia
was famous for its pomegranates.<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c012'><sup>[690]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of this fruit, which the Bœotians call
<em>sidè</em>, Agatharchides relates the following anecdote:
A dispute arising between the Athenians and B&oelig;otians,
respecting a spot called <em>Sidè</em>, situated on the
borders, Epaminondas, in order to decide the question,
took out a pomegranate from under his robe,
and demanded of the Athenians, what they called
it. “<em>Rhoa</em>” they replied. “Very good,” said Epaminondas;
<a id='corr164.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='but'>“but</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_164.20'><ins class='correction' title='but'>“but</ins></a></span> we call it <em>Sidè</em>, and, as the place
derives its name from the fruit which grows there
in abundance, it is clear the land must belong to
us.” And it was decided in favour of the Bœotians.<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c012'><sup>[691]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>We have already observed, that the palm-tree
flourished and produced dates in Greece, particularly
in Attica and Delos;<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c012'><sup>[692]</sup></a> but it is clear, from a
remark of Xenophon, that these dates were small
and of an inferior quality; for, speaking of the productions
of Mesopotamia, he says, that they set
aside for the slaves such dates as resembled those
produced in Greece, while the larger and finer kinds,<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c012'><sup>[693]</sup></a>
which were like amber in colour, they selected for
their own use. They were also dried, as they still
are in the East, to be eaten as a dessert, at other
seasons of the year. From which we learn, that
the black date, which is larger and finer than the
yellow, was not then cultivated in Persia. But
neither dates, nor any other fruit, could compare
with the grape, which is found in perfection in almost
every part of Greece, where, as in Burgundy and, I
presume, in the rest of France, the law regulated
the period of the vintage, prohibiting individuals
from gathering their grapes earlier under a heavy
penalty.<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c012'><sup>[694]</sup></a> The best kind of grape in Attica, like
that of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Clos Vougeot</i></span> in Burgundy, was the <em>Nikostrateios</em>,
supposed to be unrivalled for excellence,
though the Rhodians pretended, in their <em>Hipponion</em>,
to possess its equal.<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c012'><sup>[695]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the grape we pass naturally to wine, which
has of itself formed the subject of many treatises.
It will not, therefore, be expected that we should
enter into very minute details; though, if we are
sparing, it will certainly not be for want of materials.
D’Herbelot<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c012'><sup>[696]</sup></a> relates an oriental tradition which attributes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the invention of wine to the ancient Persian
monarch Giamshid; and Bochart, with some
show of ingenuity, attributes to Bacchos, the Grecian
inventor and god of wine, an origin which
would confound him with the founder of Babylon.<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c012'><sup>[697]</sup></a>
A very celebrated wine, called <em>nectar</em>, is said to
have been produced in the neighbourhood of that
city.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c012'><sup>[698]</sup></a> But, according to Theopompos, it was the
inhabitants of Chios who first planted and cultivated
the vine, and from them the knowledge was transmitted
to the other Greeks.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c012'><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Theophrastus<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c012'><sup>[700]</sup></a> relates that, in the territory of
Heraclea, in Arcadia, there was a wine which rendered
men insane and women prolific.<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c012'><sup>[701]</sup></a> In the
environs of Cerynia, in Achaia, grew a vine, the
wine of which blasted the fruit of the womb, nay,
the very grapes were said to possess a similar quality.<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c012'><sup>[702]</sup></a>
At Thasos were two kinds of wine, of which
the one caused stupefaction, while the other was in
the highest degree exhilarating.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c012'><sup>[703]</sup></a> The wine called
anthosmias,<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c012'><sup>[704]</sup></a> according to Phanias of Eresos, was
produced by mixing one part of salt-water with
fifty parts of wine, and it was considered best when
made with the grapes of young vines. The comic
poets are eloquent in praise of the wines of Thasos,
particularly of that mixed sort, of most agreeable
flavour, which was drunk in their Prytaneion. Theophrastus<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c012'><sup>[705]</sup></a>
gives the recipe for making it. They threw,
he says, into the jars, a small quantity of flour
kneaded with honey, the latter to impart a sweet
odour to the wine, the former mildness. A similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>effect was produced by mixing up hard inodorous
wine with one which was oily and fragrant.<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c012'><sup>[706]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The wines of Cos, Myndos, and Halicarnassos, being
thought to temper the crudity of rain and well-water,
were, therefore, like all others containing a quantity
of salt-water, in great request at Athens and Sicyon,
where the springs were harsh. The Mareotic wine<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c012'><sup>[707]</sup></a>
was made from vineyards on the banks of the lake
Mareotis, where the present Pasha has his gardens,
in the vicinity of Marea, once a place of considerable
importance, but now a small village. Attempts, however,
have been made by M. Abro, an Armenian, once
more to cover the ancient sites with vineyards, several
acres of ground being planted with cuttings imported
from the great nursery grounds at Chambéry, in Savoy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The town of Marea derived its name, according to
tradition, from Maron,<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c012'><sup>[708]</sup></a> a person who accompanied
Bacchos in his military expedition, and, in honour of
its founder, surrounded itself with the fruit-tree most
agreeable to that god. The grapes here produced
were delicious, and the wine, slightly astringent and
aromatic, had an exquisite flavour. The Mareotic
was white, of delicate taste, light, sparkling, and by
no means heady. The best sort was the Tæniotic,
so called from the <em>tænia</em>, “sandy eminences,” on which
the vineyards were situated. This wine, in its pure
state, had a greenish tinge, like the Johanisberg, and
was rich and unctuous; but, mingled with water, it
assumed the colour of Attic honey. By degrees the
vine grew to be cultivated along the whole course
of the Nile,<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c012'><sup>[709]</sup></a> but its produce differed greatly in different
places, both in colour and quality. Among the
best was that of Antylla, a city near Alexandria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the revenues arising from which the ancient kings of
Egypt, and afterwards those of Persia, settled on their
queens for their girdle. The wines of the Thebaid,
particularly those made about Koptos, were so extremely
light as to be given even in fevers, as, moreover,
they passed quickly, and greatly promoted digestion.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c012'><sup>[710]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>According to Nicander of Colophon, the word οἶνος,
“wine,” was derived from the name of <em>Oineus</em>, who
having squeezed out the juice of the grape into vases,
called it, after his own name, <em>wine</em>. Diphilos,<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c012'><sup>[711]</sup></a> the
comic poet, gives us, however, something better than
etymologies in that burst of Bacchic enthusiasm in
which, in verses fragrant as Burgundy, he celebrates
the praises of the gift of Dionysos:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

      <div class='line'>“Oh! friend to the wise, to the children of song,</div>
      <div class='line'>Take me with thee, thou wisest and sweetest, along;</div>
      <div class='line'>To the humble, the lowly, proud thoughts dost thou bring,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the wretch who has thee is as blythe as a king:</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c014'>Nectar, the poetical drink of the gods, was a
sort of wine made near Olympos in Lydia, by mingling
with the juice of the grape a little pure
honey and flowers of delicate fragrance. Anaxandrides,
indeed, regards the nectar as the food of
the immortals, and ambrosia as their wine; in which
opinion he is upheld by Alcman and Sappho. But
Homer and Ibycos take an opposite view of the
matter.<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c012'><sup>[712]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Alexis speaks of those who are half-seas-over
as much addicted to reasoning. Nicænetus<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c012'><sup>[713]</sup></a> considers
wine as the Pegasus of a poet, mounted on
the wings of which like Trygæos on his beetle he
soars “to the bright heaven of invention.” At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>port of Munychia, too, good wine was held in high
estimation; indeed, the honest folks of this borough,
with small respect for the water nymphs,
paid particular honour to the hero <em>Acratopotes</em>, that
is, in plain English, “one who drinks unmixed
wine.” Even among the Spartans,<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c012'><sup>[714]</sup></a> in spite of their
cothons, and black broth, certain culinary artistes
set up in the Phydition, or common dining-hall,
statues in honour of the heroes <em>Matton</em> and <em>Keraon</em>,
that is, the genii of eating and drinking. In
Achaia, too, much reverence was paid to <em>Deipneus</em>,
or the god who presides over good suppers.<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c012'><sup>[715]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the Greeks had a marvellous respect for wine
they, like the German paper enthusiast, almost appeared
to imagine it could be made out of a stone.
They had, accordingly, fig wine,<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c012'><sup>[716]</sup></a> root wine, palm
wine, and so on; and their made or mixed wines
were without number. There was scarcely an
island or city in the Mediterranean that did not
export its wines to Athens: they had the Lesbian,
the Eub&oelig;an, the Peparethian, the Chalybonian, the
Thasian, the Pramnian, and the Port wine. We
have already observed, that wine was drunk mixed
with flour,<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c012'><sup>[717]</sup></a> and in the island of Theræ it was
thickened with the yolk of an egg. In the Megaris
they prepared with raisins or dried grapes<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c012'><sup>[718]</sup></a>
a wine called <em>passon</em>, in taste resembling the Ægosthenic
sweet wine, or the Cretan malmsey. But,
however exquisite the wines themselves, it was not
thought enough in the summer months unless they
were brought to table cooled with ice or snow,<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c012'><sup>[719]</sup></a>
which was accordingly the practice.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER V. <br /> ENTERTAINMENTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Having now gone rapidly through the materials
of which Grecian repasts consisted, it will next be
necessary to describe the manner in which all these
good things were disposed of, first to maintain the
energy of the frame, and secondly, for mere pleasure
and pastime. Locke, with many other modern
philosophers, erroneously supposes the Greeks of remote
antiquity to have been so abstemious as to
content themselves with one meal per diem. But
experience appears to have led all mankind on this
point to much the same conclusion; viz., that
health and comfort require men to eat at least
thrice in the day,<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c012'><sup>[720]</sup></a> which accordingly was the practice
of the ancient Greeks, though Philemon and
others enumerate four repasts. Our own ancestors,
before the introduction of tea and coffee, appear
to have been very well content with beer or ale
for their morning’s meal, so that we could not pity
the Greeks even though it should be found that
they had nothing better<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c012'><sup>[721]</sup></a> than hot rolls, muffins,
or crumpets, with strawberries, grapes, pears, and
a flask of Chian or Falernian. But they soon found
the necessity of some warm beverage; and though
it does not appear how it was prepared, they had
a substitute for tea,<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c012'><sup>[722]</sup></a> in use at Athens, in Eubœa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>in Crete, and, no doubt, in all other parts
of Greece. This meal, of whatever it consisted,
was called <em>acratisma</em>, or <em>ariston</em>, and eaten at break
of day.<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c012'><sup>[723]</sup></a> Homer’s heroes, whose business was fighting,
just snatched a hasty meal, and hurried to the
field; but at Athens, where people had other employments,
they breakfasted early, to allow themselves
ample time for despatching their affairs in
the city, if they had any, and afterwards at their
neighbouring farms or villas.<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c012'><sup>[724]</sup></a> The second repast,
<em>deipnon</em>, or dinner, seems to have been eaten about
eleven or twelve o’clock: the <em>hesperisma</em>,<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c012'><sup>[725]</sup></a> equivalent
to our tea, late in the afternoon, and the
<em>dorpon</em>, or supper, the last thing in the evening.
But of these meals two only were serious affairs,
and the <em>hesperisma</em> was often dispensed with altogether.
In fact, Athenæus, a great authority
on this subject, considers it perfectly absurd to
suppose, that the frugal ancients could have
thought of eating so often as three times in one
day.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c012'><sup>[726]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the greater includes the less, instead of confining
ourselves to the ordinary daily dinner of a
Greek, we shall in preference describe their grand
entertainments, introducing remarks on the former
by the way. These repasts were divided into three
classes, the public dinner, the pic-nic, and the marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>feast. The last, so far as it had any peculiar
features, has been described among the circumstances
attending matrimony. We have, therefore, for
the present, to do with two only; and, as the
Greek contrived to throw much of his ingenuity
into all matters connected with feasting and merry-making,
the discussion of this part of our subject
should savour strongly of mirth and jollity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grand dinner,<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c012'><sup>[727]</sup></a> which they called <em>eilapinè</em>, was
generally given at the expense of an individual, and
its sumptuousness knew no limit but the means of
the host. Other kinds of feasts there were at which
all the members of a tribe, a borough, or a fraternity,
were entertained, not to speak for the present of the
common tables of the Cretans, Spartans, or Prytanes
of Athens. We now confine ourselves to those jovial
assemblages of private citizens whose object in meeting
was not so much the dinner, though that was
not overlooked, as the elevation of animal spirits and
flow of soul produced by the union of a thousand
different circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a rich man desired to see his friends around
him at his board, he delivered to his <em>deipnocletor</em><a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c012'><sup>[728]</sup></a>
a domestic kept for this purpose, a tablet, or as we
should say, a card, whereon the names of the persons
to be invited, with the day and hour fixed
upon for the banquet, were inscribed. With brothers
and other very near relations this ceremony was
thought unnecessary.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c012'><sup>[729]</sup></a> They came without invitation.
So likewise did another class of men, who,
living at large upon the public and lighting unbidden
upon any sport to which they were attracted by the
savour of a good dinner, were denominated<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c012'><sup>[730]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Flies</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>and occasionally <span class='sc'>Shades</span> or <span class='sc'>Parasites</span>. There was
at one time a law at Athens, which a good deal
nonplussed these gentlemen. It was decreed, that
not more than thirty persons should meet at a marriage
feast, and a wealthy citizen, desirous of “going
the whole hog,” had invited the full complement.
An honest Fly, however, who respected no law that
interfered with his stomach, contrived to introduce
himself, and took his station at the lower end of
the table. Presently the magistrate appointed for the
purpose, entered, and espying his man at a glance,
began counting the guests, commencing on the other
side and ending with the parasite. “Friend,” said
he, “you must retire. I find there is one person
more than the law allows.” “It is quite a mistake,
sir,” replied the Fly, “as you will find if you
will have the goodness to count again, beginning
<em>on this side</em>.”<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c012'><sup>[731]</sup></a> Among the Egyptians, who shrouded
all their poetry in hieroglyphics, <em>a fly</em> was the emblem
of impudence, which necessarily formed the
principal qualification of a Parasite, and in Hume’s<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c012'><sup>[732]</sup></a>
opinion is no bad possession to any man who would
make his way in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archbishop Potter,<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c012'><sup>[733]</sup></a> in his account of Grecian entertainments,
observes, upon the authority of Cicero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>and Cornelius Nepos, that women were never invited
with the men.<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c012'><sup>[734]</sup></a> But in this, as has been
shown in the proper place, he was misled by those
learned Romans; for, in many cities and colonies of
Greece, no banquet was given at which they were
not present. Even at Athens, where women of
character thought it unbecoming to mingle in the
convivial revelries of the men,<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c012'><sup>[735]</sup></a> in which wine constantly
overleaps the boundaries of decorum, their
place was supplied by hetairæ, whose polished manners,
ready wit, and enlarged and enlightened understandings,
recommended them to their companions,
and caused the laxity of their morals to be forgotten.<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c012'><sup>[736]</sup></a>
To proceed, however, with our feast: it will
readily be supposed, that gentlemen invited out to
dinner were careful to apparel themselves elegantly,
to shave clean, and arrange their beards and moustachios
after the most approved fashion of the day.
Even Socrates, who cared as little as most people
for external appearances, bathed, put on a pair of
new shoes, brushed his chlamys, and otherwise spruced
himself up when going to sup at Agathon’s with
Phædros, Aristophanes, Eryximachos, and other exquisites.
Even in Homeric times the bath was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>among the preliminaries to dinner, and guests arriving
from a distance were attended through all the
operations of the toilette by female slaves.<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c012'><sup>[737]</sup></a> But
this general ablution was not considered sufficient.
On sitting down to table water was again presented
to every guest in silver<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c012'><sup>[738]</sup></a> lavers or ewers of gold.
And since they ate with their fingers, as still is
the practice in the Levant, it was moreover customary
to wash the hands between every course,<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c012'><sup>[739]</sup></a> and
wipe them,<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c012'><sup>[740]</sup></a> in remoter ages, with soft bread, which
was thrown to the dogs, and in aftertimes with napkins.
The Arcadians, however, about whose mountains
all the old superstitions of Hellas clung like
bats, found a very different use for the cakes with
which they wiped their fingers. They supposed
them to acquire some mystic powers by the operation,
and preserved them as a charm against ghosts.<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c012'><sup>[741]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But we are proceeding too fast, for the guests
are scarcely within doors, and our imagination has
jumped to the conclusion. To return then. Immediately
on entering, and when the host had welcomed
and shaken hands with all, such gentlemen as possessed
beards<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c012'><sup>[742]</sup></a> had them perfumed over burning censers
of frankincense, as ladies have their tresses on
visiting a Turkish harem. The hands, too, after each
lavation, were scented.<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c012'><sup>[743]</sup></a> Before sitting down to table,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and while the cooks were peppering the soup, frying
the fish, or giving the roast-meat another turn,
politeness required the guests to take a stroll<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c012'><sup>[744]</sup></a> in
the picture-gallery and admire the exquisite taste
of their entertainer in articles of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>virtu</i></span>.<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c012'><sup>[745]</sup></a> Here while
the scent of the savoury viands found its way through
every apartment, and set the bowels of the hungry
parasites croaking, the rogues who had lunched well
at home leisurely discussed the merits of Zeuxis or
Parrhasios, of Pheidias or Polygnotos, or opened
wide their eyes at the microscopic creations of
that Spartan artist whose chisel produced a chariot
and four that could be hidden under the wing of
a fly. At length, however, the connoisseurs were interrupted
in their learned disquisitions by the entrance
of Xanthos, Davos, or Lydos, with the welcome intelligence
that dinner was on the table.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the appetites of the gourmands had still to
encounter another trial.<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c012'><sup>[746]</sup></a> The Greeks were above
all things a pious people, and regarded every banquet,
nay, every meal, in the light of a sacrifice, at
which the first and best portion should be offered
as an oblation to the gods,<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c012'><sup>[747]</sup></a> with invocations and
prayer, after which it was considered lawful to attend
to their own appetites. An altar, accordingly,
of Zeus stood in the midst of every dining-room,
on which these ceremonies were performed, and libations
of pure wine poured.<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c012'><sup>[748]</sup></a> This done, the guests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>took their places, in the earlier ages on chairs, but
afterwards, when they had become familiar with the
East, on rich sofas, arranged round the board.<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c012'><sup>[749]</sup></a> Occasionally,
however, even so late as the age of Alexander,<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c012'><sup>[750]</sup></a>
princes and other great men chose to adopt
the ancient custom, and, on one occasion, that conqueror
himself entertained four hundred of his officers,
when seats of wrought silver, covered with
purple carpets, were provided for all.</p>

<p class='c001'>The manner of reclining on the divans was not
a little ludicrous. For, at the outset, while the appetite
was keen, they stretched themselves flat upon
their stomachs, in order, I presume, to command
the use of both hands, and putting forward their
mouths towards the table looked like so many sparrows
with their open bills projecting over the nest.
But this they could conveniently do only when they
had a large space to themselves. When packed
close, as usually they were, one man, the chief in
dignity, throwing off his shoes,<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c012'><sup>[751]</sup></a> placed himself on
the upper end of the divan, that is, next the host,
reclining on one elbow supported by soft cushions.
The head of the next man reached nearly to his
breast,—whence in Scripture, the beloved disciple
is said to recline on the bosom of Christ,<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c012'><sup>[752]</sup></a>—while
the feet of the first extended down behind him.
The third guest occupied the same position with
respect to the second, and so on until five individuals
sometimes crowded each other on the same
sofa.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the heaven of the poets was but a colossal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>picture of earth, we may, from the practice of the
gods, infer what took place among mortals, even
where supported by no direct testimony. Now, in
Homer, we find gods and goddesses mingling freely
together at the feast. Zeus takes the head of
the table, next him sits his daughter Athena, while
the imperial Hera, as Queen of Heaven, takes precedence
of all the she Olympians, by placing herself
at the head of the secondary divinities, directly
opposite her husband. On one occasion we find
Athena, the type of hospitality and politeness, yielding
up her seat of honour to Thetis, because, as an
Oceanid, she was somewhat of a stranger in Olympos.<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c012'><sup>[753]</sup></a>
Potter has discussed, with more learning than
perspicuity, the question of precedence at table.
To render the matter perfectly intelligible would
require a plan of the dining-room; but wanting this,
it may be observed, that in Persia the king, or host
of whatever rank, sat in the middle, while the guests
ranged themselves equally on both sides of him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Greece, the bottom of the table was the end
next the door. Here no one sat, it being left open
for the servants to bring in and remove the dishes.
From this point, on either side, the seats augmented
in value, and consequently the post of greatest
honour was the middle of the other extremity.<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c012'><sup>[754]</sup></a>
There were those, however, who made no account
of these matters, but suffered their guests to seat
themselves as they pleased. This was the case with
Timon, who, having invited a very miscellaneous
party, would not be at the pains to settle the question
of precedence between them; but a pompous
individual of aristocratic pretensions, dressed like an
actor, arriving late with a large retinue, and surveying
the company from the door, went away again,
observing, there was no fit place left for him. Upon
which the guests, who, as Plutarch remarks, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>far gone in their cups, burst into shouts of laughter,
and bade him make the best of his way home.<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c012'><sup>[755]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Some persons observed a very different order in
arranging their guests, grouping those together whom
they considered suited by age or temper to each
other, in order by this contrivance to produce general
harmony,—the vehement and impetuous being
placed beside the meek and gentle, the silent beside
the talkative, the ripe and full and expansive
minds beside those who were ready to receive instruction.
But very often, as at Agathon’s, those
sat next each other, who were most intimately acquainted
or united together by friendship; for thus
the greatest freedom of intercourse with the brightest
sallies of convivial wit were likely to be produced.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length, however, we must imagine the guests
in their places and every thing in proper train. The
servants bring in first one well-covered table, then
a second, then a third, till the whole room is filled
with dainties. Brilliant lamps and chandeliers poured
a flood of light over the crowned heads of the guests,
over the piled sweetmeats, over the shining dishes,
and all the baits with which the appetite is caught.
Then, on silver pateræ, cakes whiter than snow were
served round. To these succeeded eggs, pungent
herbs, oysters, and thrushes.<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c012'><sup>[756]</sup></a> Next several dishes
of rich eels, brown and crisp, sprinkled thickly with
salt, followed by a delicious conger dressed with
every rare device of cookery, calculated to delight
the palate of the gods. Then came the belly of a
large ray, round as a hoop; dishes, containing, one
some slices of a sea-dog, another garnished with a
sparos, a third with a cuttle-fish, or smoking polypus
whose legs were tender as a chicken. While the
sight of these dainties was feasting the eyes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>guests, the noses of the experienced informed them
of the approach of a synodon,<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c012'><sup>[757]</sup></a> which perfumed the
passages all the way from the kitchen, and, flanked
with calamaries, covered the whole table. Shrimps
too were there in their yellow cuirasses, sweet in
flavour as honey, with delicious varieties of puff pastry
bordered with fresh green foliage.<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c012'><sup>[758]</sup></a> The teeth
of the parasites watered at the sight. But while
deeply engaged in the discussion of these good things,
in came some smoking slices of broiled thunny, a mullet
fresh from the fish-kettle, with the teats of a
young sow cooked <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en ragoût</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pleasure of all kinds being supposed to promote
digestion, female singers, flute-players and dancers,
were meanwhile exercising their several arts for the
entertainment of the guests. But as they paid very
little attention to them till the rage of hunger was
appeased, we shall imitate their example, and proceed
with the gourmandize. One of the greatest accomplishments
a boon companion could possess, was the
power to seize with the fingers, and swallow hissing-hot,
slices of grilled fish or morsels of lamb or veal
broiled like kabobs, so as to be slightly burnt and
cracking externally, while all the juice and flavour
of the meat remained within. And the acquirement
being highly important, great pains were taken
to become masters of it. For this purpose some
accustomed themselves daily to play with hot pokers,
others case-hardened their fingers by repeatedly
dipping them in water as hot as they could bear,
and gargled their throats with the same, while one
famous gourmand, more inventive than the rest, hit
upon the ingenious device of wearing metallic fingerlings
with which he could have seized a kabob
even from the gridiron. These proficients in the art
of eating, an art practised indeed by all, but possessed
in perfection by very few, enjoyed great advantages
over the ignorant and uninitiated. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>accordingly, when invited out, they generally succeeded
in bribing the cook to send in all his dishes hot as
Phlegethon, that, while the more modest and inexperienced
guests sat gazing on, they might secure
the best cuts, and come again before the others
could venture on a mouthful.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the articles served up in this scorching state
were calf’s pluck, pig’s harslet, with the chine, the
kidneys, and a variety of small hors-d’œuvre. To
these may be added the head of a sucking-kid which
had tasted nothing but milk, baked between two
dishes well luted together; giblets boiled; small,
delicate hams with their white sward unbroken; pigs’
snouts and feet swimming in white sauce, which the
gourmand Philoxenos thought a rare invention.
Roast kid and lamb’s chitterlings, or the same viands
boiled, formed a supplement to the dishes above enumerated,
and were usually done so exactly to a turn,
that even the gods, Bacchos for example, and Hermes,
the parasites of Olympos, might have descended expressly
to wag their beards over them. But the Levantines
have always been enamoured of variety in cookery.
Lady Wortley Montague counted fifty dishes
served up in succession at the Sultana Hafiten’s table;
and this she-barbarian, with all her wealth, could
never rival the variety of invention of an ancient Eleian
or Sicilian cook, who usually closed the list of his
dainties with hare, chickens roasted to the gold-colour
celebrated by Aristophanes, partridges, pheasants,
wood-pigeons or turtle-doves, which your true gourmand
should eat in the Thebaid, immediately after
the close of harvest. But the dinner was not yet
over. There still remained the dessert to be disposed
of, consisting of pure honey from the district of the
silver mines, curdled cream, cheese-tarts, and all
that profusion of southern fruit of which we have
already spoken.<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c012'><sup>[759]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is a well-known rule among modern gourmands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>that no man should utter a syllable at table till the
first course is removed, and precisely the same regulation
prevailed among the ancients. Silence, however,
was sometimes interrupted by the arrival of some
wandering buffoon, who, after long roaming about in
search of a dinner, happened, perhaps, to be attracted
thither by the wings and feathers ostentatiously scattered
before the door. This sort of gentry required
no introduction: they had only to knock and announce
themselves to ensure a ready welcome; for
most men would willingly part with a share of their
supper to be made merry over the remainder. The
Athenian demos was pre-eminently of this humour.
No king, in fact, ever kept up so large an establishment
of fools by profession, or, which is much the
same thing, of wits,—fellows who grind their understandings
into pointed jests to tickle the risible muscles
and expand the mouths of sleek junketters, who
esteem nothing beyond eating and grinning.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a feast given by Callias, the famous jester,
Philip, a-kin in spirit, I trow, to him of Macedon, presented
himself in this way, and, on being admitted,—“Gentlemen,”
said he, “you know my profession and
its privileges, relying on which I am come uninvited,
being a foe to all ceremony, and desiring to
spare you the trouble of a formal invitation.”—“Take
your place,” replied the host; “your company
was much needed, for our friends appear to be
plunged up to the chin in gravity, and would be
greatly benefited by a hearty laugh.”<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c012'><sup>[760]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In fact, the heads of the honest people were filled
with very serious meditations, being all in love, and endeavouring
to discover how each might excel the other
in absurdity. Philip began to fear, therefore, that he
had carried his jests to a bad market, and, in reality,
made many vain attempts to kindle the spirit of
mirth, and call home the imaginations of persons who
had evidently suffered them to stray as far as the
clouds. Aware that success on this point was indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>to his subsistence, the jester grew piqued
at the indifference of his hearers, and breaking off
in the midst of his supper, wrapped up his head in
his chlamys, and lay down like one about to die.
“What, now!” cried Callias. “Has any sudden panic
seized on thee, friend?”—“The worst possible, by
Zeus!” replied Philip; “for, since laughter, like
justice, has taken its leave of earth, my occupation
is gone. Hitherto I have enjoyed some celebrity
in this way, living at the public expense, like the
guests of the Prytaneion, because my drollery was
effective, and could set the table in a roar. But it
is all over, I see, with me now, for I might as soon
hope to render myself immortal as acquire serious
habits.” All this he uttered in a pouting, desponding
tone, as if about to shed tears. The company, to
humour the joke, undertook to comfort him, and the
effect of their mock condolences, and assurances that
they would laugh if he continued his supper, was so
irresistibly ludicrous, that Autolychos, a youthful
friend of Callias, was at length unable to restrain
his merriment; upon which the jester took courage,
and apostrophising his soul, informed it very gravely,
that there would be no necessity for them to part
company yet.<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c012'><sup>[761]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks had, properly speaking, no drawing-rooms,
so that, instead of retreating to another
part of the house, they had the tables themselves
removed immediately after dinner. Libations were
then poured out to Zeus Teleios, and having sung
a hymn to Phœbos Apollo, the amusements of the
evening commenced. Professional singers and musicians
were always hired on these occasions. They
were female slaves, selected in childhood for their
beauty and budding talents, and carefully educated
by their owners.<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c012'><sup>[762]</sup></a> When not already engaged, they
stood in blooming bevies in the agora, waiting, like
the Labourers of Scripture, until some one should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>hire them, upon which they proceeded, dressed and
ornamented with great elegance, to the house of
feasting. But, besides these, there were other <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>artistes</i></span>
who contributed to the entertainment of the
demos, persons that, like our Indian jugglers, performed
wonderful feats by way of interlude between
the regular exhibitions of the damsels from the agora.<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c012'><sup>[763]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Xenophon introduces into that living picture of
Greek manners called the Banquet, a company of
this kind. Finding Philip’s jokes dull things, he
brings upon the scene a strolling Syracusan, with
a beautiful female flute-player, a dancing girl who
could perform surpassing feats of activity, and a
handsome boy, who, besides performing on the cithara,
was likewise able, on occasion, to sport the toe like
his female companions.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, where philosophers were present, amusements
of this kind were not allowed to occupy their whole
attention. Every thing that occurred was made a
handle for conversation, so that discussions, more or
less lively, according to the temperament or ability
of the interlocutors, formed the solid ground-work
upon which the flowers of gaiety and laughter were
spread. It was usual, immediately after supper, to
perfume the guests, and great was the variety of
unguents, essences, and odorous oils, made use of
by the rich and vain upon these occasions; but when
Callias proposed conforming to the mode in this
particular, Socrates objected, observing, that the
odour of honourable toil was perfume enough for a
man.<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c012'><sup>[764]</sup></a> Women, indeed, to whom every thing sweet
and beautiful naturally belongs, might, he admitted,
make use of perfume, and they did so most lavishly
as we have already shown, when we entered their
dressing-room and assisted at their toilette.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks, however, were careful not to convert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>their pleasure-parties into a mere arena for the exhibition
of dialectic power. They from time to time
glanced at philosophy, but only by the way, in the
moments of transition from one variety of recreation
to another. Their conversation was now and then
brought to a pause by the rising of dancing girls,<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c012'><sup>[765]</sup></a>
robed elegantly, as we behold them still on vases
and on bas-reliefs, in drapery adapted to display
all the beauty of their forms. Hoops were brought
them, and while musicians of their own sex called
forth thrilling harmonies from the flute, they executed
a variety of graceful movements, in part
pantomimic,—now casting up the hoops, now catching
them as they fell, keeping time exactly with the
cadences of the flute. Their skill in this accomplishment
was so great, that many were enabled to
keep up twelve hoops in the air at the same time,
while others made use of poniards.<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c012'><sup>[766]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When the novelty of this exhibition was worn
off a little, other different feats followed. A hoop
stuck all round with upright swords was placed in
the midst of the apartment, into which one of the
dancing girls threw herself head foremost, and while
standing on her head balanced the lower part of
her body round over the naked points, to the infinite
terror of the spectators. She would then dart
forth between the swords, and, with a single bound,
regain her footing without the circle.<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c012'><sup>[767]</sup></a> To add to
the entertainment of the company, some parasitical
buffoon would at times undertake to exhibit his
awkwardness as a foil to the grace of the dancers,
frisking about with the clumsy heaviness of a bear,
and exaggerating his own ignorance of orchestics to
excite a laugh. Sometimes the female dancer, like
our own fair tumblers, would throw back her head
till it reached her heels, and then putting herself
in motion, roll about the room like a <a id='corr185.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hoop'>hoop.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_185.37'><ins class='correction' title='hoop'>hoop.</ins></a></span><a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c012'><sup>[768]</sup></a> To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>these, as a relief and a change, would succeed, perhaps,
a youth with fine rich voice, who accompanied
himself on the lyre with a song.</p>

<p class='c001'>But nothing could entirely restrain the Greeks
from indulging in the pleasure of listening to their
own voices. The buzz of conversation would soon
be heard in different parts of the room, which,
when Socrates was present, sometimes provoked
from him a sarcastic reproof. For example, at
Callias’s dinner, observing the company broken up
into knots, each labouring at some particular question
in dialectics, and filling the apartment with a
babel of confused murmurs; “As we talk all at
once,” said he, “we may as well sing all at
once;” and without further ceremony he pitched
his voice and began a song.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c012'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But when professed jugglers happened to be present,
gentlemen were not long abandoned to their
own resources for amusement. Trick followed trick
in rapid succession. To the pantomimic dances, and
the sword circle, succeeded the exhibition of the
potter’s wheel, in which a young girl seated on this
machine, like a little Nubian at a cow’s-tail in a
<em>sakia</em>, was whirled round with great velocity,<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c012'><sup>[770]</sup></a> but
retained so much self-possession as to be able both
to write and to read. These, however, were merely
sources of momentary wonder. Other amusements
succeeded capable of exciting superior delight, such
for example, as the mimetic dance, which, like that
of the ghawazi, could tell a whole story of love, of
adventure, of war, of religious frenzy and enthusiasm,
transporting by vivid representations the fancy
of the spectators to warmer or wilder scenes, calling
up images and reminiscences of times long past, or
steeping the thoughts in poetical dreams, filled with
the caverned nymphs, the merry Seileni, the frisking
satyrs, Bacchos, Pan, the Hours, the Graces, sporting
by moonlit fountains, through antique woods,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>or on the shelled and sand-ribbed margin of the
ocean.<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c012'><sup>[771]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On some occasions a slight dramatic scene was
represented. Clearing the centre of the banqueting
hall, the guests ranged themselves in order as at
the theatre. A throne was then set up in the open
space, and a female actor, representing Ariadne, entering,
took her seat upon it, decked and habited
like a bride, and supposed to be in her Thalamos at
Naxos. Dionysos, who has been dining with Zeus,
comes flushed with Olympian nectar into the harem
to the sound of the Bacchic flute, while the nymph
who has heard his approaching footsteps makes it
manifest by her behaviour that her soul is filled
with joy, though she neither advances nor rises to
meet him, but restrains her feelings with difficulty,
and remains apparently tranquil. The god, drawing
near with impassioned looks, and dancing all the
while, now seats himself, and places the fair one on
his knee. Then, in imitation of mortal lovers, he
embraces and kisses her, nothing loth; for, though
she hangs down her head, and would wish to appear
out of countenance, her arms find their way
round his neck and return his embrace. At this
the company, we may be sure, clapped and shouted.
The god, encouraged by their plaudits, then stood
up with his bride, and going through the whole
pantomime of courtship, not coldly and insipidly,
but as one whose heart was touched, at length
demanded of Ariadne if in truth she loved him.
Sometimes the mimic scene concealed beneath it
all the reality of passion. From personating enamoured
characters, the youthful actor and his partner
learned in reality to love; and what was amusement
to others contained a deep and serious meaning
for them. This, Xenophon says, was the case with
the youth and maiden who enlivened the banquet
of Callias. Absorbed in the earnestness of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>feelings, they seem to have forgotten the presence
of spectators, and instead of a stage representation,
gave them a scene from real life, where every impassioned
look and gesture were genuine, and every
fiery glance was kindled at the heart.<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c012'><sup>[772]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, may be considered a serious amusement,
and something like broad farce was necessary
to awaken the guests from the reverie into which
the love scene had plunged them. Jesters were,
therefore, put in requisition; and, as even they
sometimes failed to raise a laugh, their more humorous
brethren the wits and jesters of the forests,
or, in the language of mortals, monkeys were called
upon to dissipate the clouds of seriousness. These
were the favourite buffoons of the Scythian Anacharsis,—not
the Abbé Barthélemy’s,—who said,
he could laugh at a monkey’s tricks, because his
tricks were natural, but that he found no amusement
in a man who made a trade of it.<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c012'><sup>[773]</sup></a> Nor
could Euripides at all relish punsters and manufacturers
of jokes, whom he considered, with some
reason, as a species of animal distinct from mankind.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Many there be who exercise their wits</div>
      <div class='line'>In giving birth, by cutting jests, to laughter.</div>
      <div class='line'>I hate the knaves whose rude unbridled tongues</div>
      <div class='line'>Sport with the wise; and cannot for my life</div>
      <div class='line'>Think they are men, though laughter doth become them,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they have houses filled with treasured stores</div>
      <div class='line'>From distant lands.<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c012'><sup>[774]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But if Euripides found nothing desirable in laughter,
there were those who had a clean contrary creed,
and lamented nothing so much as the loss of their
risible faculties. On this subject Semos has a story
quite <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span>. Parmeniscos, the Metapontine, having
descended, he says, into the cave of Trophonios,
became so extremely grave, that with all the appliances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and means to boot, furnished by wealth,
and they were not a few, he thereafter found himself
quite unable to screw up his muscles into a
smile; which taking much to heart, as was natural,
he made a pilgrimage to Delphi, to inquire by what
means he might rid himself of the blue devils. Somewhat
puzzled at the strangeness of the inquiry, the
Pythoness replied,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Poor mortal unmerry, who seekest to know</div>
      <div class='line'>What will bid thy brow soften, thy quips and cranks flow,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the house of the mother I bid thee repair—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou wilt find, if she’s pleased, what thy heart covets, there.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Upon this, Parmeniscos hastened homeward, hoping
soon to enjoy a good laugh as the reward of his industry;
but, finding his features remain fixed as cast-iron,
he began to suspect the oracle had deceived him.
Some time after, being at Delos, he beheld with admiration
the several wonders of the island, and, lastly,
proceeded to the temple of Leto, expecting to find in
the mother of Apollo something worthy of so great
a divinity. But, on entering and perceiving, instead,
a grotesque and smoky old figure in wood, he burst
into an immoderate fit of laughter, whereupon the
response of the oracle recurred to his mind, and he
understood it; and, being thus delivered from his
infirmity, he ever after held the goddess in extremest
reverence.<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c012'><sup>[775]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Even from this story, therefore, it will be seen
how highly “broad grins” were estimated in antiquity,
particularly at Athens, where there was a
regular “Wits’ Club,” consisting of threescore members,
who assembled during the Diomeia,<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c012'><sup>[776]</sup></a> in the
temple of Heracles. The names of several of these
jovial mortals have come down to us; Mandrogenes,
for example, and Strato, Callimedon, who,
for some particular quality of mind or body, obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>sobriquet</i></span> of the <em>Lobster</em>, Deinias, Mnasigeiton,
and Menæchmos. The reputation of these
gentlemen spread rapidly through the city, and,
when a good thing had a run among the small wits,
it was remarked, that “the Sixty had said <em>that</em>.”
Or, if a man of talent were asked, whence he came,
he would answer, “From the Sixty.” This was in
the time of Demosthenes, when, unhappily, jesters
were in more request in Athens than soldiers; and
Philip of Macedon, himself no mean buffoon, learning
the excellent quality of their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon mots</i></span>, sent them
a present of a talent of gold, with a request that,
as public business prevented his joining the sittings
of the club, they would make for his use a collection
in writing of all their smart sayings, which
was, probably, the first step towards those repositories
for stray wit, called “Joe Millers,” that form
so indispensable a portion of a bon vivant’s library.<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c012'><sup>[777]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But we are all this while detaining the company
from their wine, and those other recreations which
the fertile genius of the Greeks invented to make
the wheels of life move smoothly. Though the tables,
according to the fashion of the times, were removed
with the solid viands, others were brought in to replace
them, on which the censers, the goblets, the
silver or golden ladles for filling the smaller cups,
were arranged in order.<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c012'><sup>[778]</sup></a> The chairman, or, as he
was then called, the king of the feast,<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c012'><sup>[779]</sup></a> enjoyed absolute
power over his subjects, and could determine
better than their own palates, how much and
how often each man should drink. This important
functionary was not always identical with the entertainer,
but sometimes his substitute, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>a person chosen by lot.<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c012'><sup>[780]</sup></a> Capacious bowls of wine,<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c012'><sup>[781]</sup></a>
mingled with water, were placed on a sideboard,
whence cup-bearers, sometimes of one, sometimes
of the other sex, but always selected for their youth
and beauty, filled, with ladles,<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c012'><sup>[782]</sup></a> the goblets of the
guests, which, when the froth rose above the brim,
were, by an obvious metaphor, said to be crowned.<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c012'><sup>[783]</sup></a>
Among the Doric Greeks, female cup-bearers seem
to have been always preferred; the Ptolemies of
Egypt cherished the same taste; and the people
of Tarentum, themselves of Doric race, passing
successively through every stage of luxury, came,
at length, to be served at table by beautiful young
women without a vestige of clothing. In most
cases, these maidens were slaves, but, in some countries,
and everywhere, in remoter ages, the performance
of such offices was not regarded as any way
derogatory to persons of noble or princely blood.
But, whatever might be their birth, beauty of form
and countenance constituted their chief recommendation.
For there is a language in looks and gestures,
there is a fountain of joy and delight concealed
deep in the physical structure, and its waters
laugh to the eye of intellect, and reflect into the
hearts of those who behold it a sunniness and exhilaration
greater than we derive from gazing on the
summer sea. Hence, Hebe and Ganymede were
chosen to minister at the tables of the gods, even
Zeus himself<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c012'><sup>[784]</sup></a> not disdaining to taste of the pleasures
to be derived from basking in the irradiations
of beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the goblets were all crowned with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>nectar of earth, the Master of the Feast<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c012'><sup>[785]</sup></a> set the
example of good-fellowship by drinking to his guests,
beginning with the most distinguished.<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c012'><sup>[786]</sup></a> Originally,
custom required him who drank to the health of
another to drain off his cup while his comrade did
the same; but, in after ages, they sipped only a portion
of the wine, and, as they still do in the East,
presented the remainder to their friend. The latter,
by the rules of politeness, was bound to finish the
goblet, or, where the antique fashion prevailed, to
drink one of equal size.<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c012'><sup>[787]</sup></a> The Macedonians, who,
probably, excelled the Greeks in drinking, if in nothing
else, disdained small cups as supplying a very
roundabout way to intoxication, and plunged into
Lethe at once by the aid of most capacious bowls.
It was customary, when the practice of passing round
the goblet had been introduced, for the king of the
feast to drink to the next man on his right hand,
who, in his turn, drank to the next, and so on till
the bowl had circulated round the board. But different
customs prevailed in the different parts of
Greece. At Athens, small cups, like our wine-glasses,
were in use; among the Chians, Thracians,
and Thessalians, nations more prone to sensual indulgences,
the goblets were of larger dimensions;
but, at Sparta, where sobriety and frugality long
flourished, the practice was to drink from diminutive
vessels, which, as often as required, were replenished
by the attendants.<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c012'><sup>[788]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Isocrates, in his exhortation to Demonicos, marks
the distinction between the true and false friend,
by observing, that, while the latter thinks only of
those around him, the former remembers the absent,
and makes his affection triumph over time and distance.
And the Greeks generally had this merit.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Amid the enjoyments of the festive board, they recalled
to mind the friends of other days; and, having
first performed libations to the gods, those best and
purest of friends, drank to the health and prosperity
of former associates, now far removed by circumstances,<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c012'><sup>[789]</sup></a>
and this they did not in the mixed beverage
which formed their habitual potations, but in
pure wine.<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c012'><sup>[790]</sup></a> There was something extremely delicate
in this idea, for tacitly it intimated, that their
love placed the objects of it almost on a level with
their divinities, in whose honour, also, on these occasions,
a small portion of the wine was spilt in
libations<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c012'><sup>[791]</sup></a> upon the earth. The young, in whose
hearts a mistress held the first place,<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c012'><sup>[792]</sup></a> drank deeply
in honour of their beloved, sometimes equalling
the number of cups to that of the letters forming
her name,<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c012'><sup>[793]</sup></a> which, if the custom prevailed so early,
would account for Ægisthos’s being a sot. Sometimes,
however, taking the hint from the number of the
Graces, they were satisfied with three goblets; but,
when an excuse for drinking “pottle deep” was
sought, they chose the Muses for their patrons, and
honoured their mistresses’ names with three times
three.<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c012'><sup>[794]</sup></a> This is the number of cheers with which
favourite political toasts are received at our public
dinners, though every one who fills his bumper, and
cries “hip, hip, hip, hurrah!” on these occasions,
is, probably, not conscious that he is keeping up an
old pagan custom in honour of the Muses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The number four was in no favour at the drinking-table,
not because it was an even number, for they
sometimes drank ten, but because some old superstition
had brought discredit on it. Our very fox-hunters,
however, exhibit an inferior capacity to many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of the ancients in affairs of the bottle, though when
it is the poets who perform the feat, we may safely
consider them to be simply regaling their fancies on
“air-drawn” goblets, which cost nothing, and leave
no head-aches behind them. On this subject there
is a very pretty song in the Anthology, which Potter,
following some old edition, completely misrepresents.<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c012'><sup>[795]</sup></a>
It deserves to be well translated, and I would translate
it well if I could. The following at least preserves
the meaning:</p>

<p class='c014'>But the Macedonians entertained no respect for
poetical goblets: they loved to scent their moustachios
with the aroma of the real rosy wine when it sparkled
in the cup,—when it moved itself aright, as the wise
king of Judah expresses it. Plutarch describes briefly
one of their drinking-bouts which took place on the
evening of the day wherein old Kalanos, the Hindù
Yoghi, burnt himself alive to escape the colic.
Alexander, on returning from the funeral pile, invited
a number of his friends and generals to sup
with him, and, proposing a drinking contest, appointed
a crown for the victor. Prodigious efforts were made
by all present to achieve so enviable a triumph; but
the man who proved himself to possess the most
capacious interior was Promachos, who is said to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>swallowed upwards of two gallons. He obtained
the prize, which was a golden crown, valued at a
talent, but died within three days.<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c012'><sup>[797]</sup></a> Chares, the Mitylenian,
relates the matter somewhat differently. According
to him, Alexander celebrated funeral games
in honour of Kalanos, at his barrow, where horseraces
and gymnastic contests took place,<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c012'><sup>[798]</sup></a> and a poetical
encomium was pronounced upon the Yoghi, who,
like the rest of his countrymen, was, doubtless, a
great toper, and thence the drinking-match instituted
in the evening. Chares says there were three prizes;
the first, in value, a talent; the second, thirty minæ,
or about a hundred and twenty pounds sterling; the
third, three minæ. The number of aspirants is not
stated, but thirty-five (Plutarch says forty-one) perished
in cold shiverings on the spot, and six more died
shortly after in the tents.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c012'><sup>[799]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Numbers have celebrated the military genius of
Alexander; but Athenæus alone has given him due
credit for his truly royal power of drinking. Like
his father, Philip, who, in his jolly humour, ruffled
the Athenian dead at Chæronea, where he could
safely beard the fallen republicans, Alexander delighted
to spend his evenings among drunken roysterers,
whose chief ambition consisted in making a butt of
their bowels. One of these worthies was Proteas,
the Macedonian mentioned by Ephippos, in his work
on the sepulture of Alexander and Hephæstion. He
was a man of iron constitution, on which wine, whatever
quantity he drank, appeared to make no impression.
Alexander, knowing this, loved to pledge
him in huge bowls, such as none, perhaps, but themselves
could cope with. This he did even at Babylon,
where the climate suffers few excesses to be
indulged in with impunity. Taking a goblet more
like a pail than a drinking-cup, Alexander caused it
to be crowned with wine, which, having tasted, he
presented the bowl to Proteas. The veteran immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>drained it off, to the great amusement of
the company, and presently afterwards, desiring to
pledge the king, he filled it up again, and sipping
a little, according to custom, passed the bowl to
Alexander, who, not to be outdone by a subject,
forthwith drank the whole. But if he possessed
the courage, he wanted the physical strength of
Proteas: the goblet dropped from his hand, his
head sank on a pillow, and a fever ensued of which
the conqueror of Persia, and the rival of Proteas
in drinking, died in a few days.<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c012'><sup>[800]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But to return from these barbarians: as the
presence of sober persons must always be felt by
hard drinkers to be a tacit reproach, it was one
of the rules of good fellowship, that all such as
joined not in the common potations should depart.
“Drink, or begone!” said the law, and a good
one in Cicero’s opinion it was, for if men experienced
no disposition to join in the mirth and
enjoyment of the company, what had they to do
there?<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c012'><sup>[801]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the existence of these rules, however, an
inference has been drawn unfavourable to the Greek
character, as if, because some were merry, the nation
generally must of necessity have been wine-bibbers.<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c012'><sup>[802]</sup></a>
But this is scarcely more logical than the
reasoning of a writer, who, because the comic poets
speak chiefly of the mirth and lighter enjoyments
of the Athenians, very gravely concludes that they
busied themselves about little else. The truth
is, that like all ardent and energetic people, they
threw their whole souls into the affair, whether
serious or otherwise, in which they happened to
be engaged; and besides, while the careful and industrious
applied themselves to business, there was
always an abundance of light and trifling people
to whom eating and drinking constituted a serious
occupation.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> ENTERTAINMENTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The man upon the creations of whose art the
principal enjoyments of Greek gourmands were based
was the cook,<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c012'><sup>[803]</sup></a> whose character and achievements
ought not perhaps to be entirely passed over. We
are, indeed, chiefly indebted for our information to
the comic poets; but, in spite of some little exaggeration,
the likeness they have bequeathed to us
is probably upon the whole pretty exact.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Athenian cook was a singularly heterogeneous
being, something between the parasite and the professed
jester; he was usually a poor citizen, with
all the pride of autochthoneïty about him, who
considered it indispensable to acquire, besides his
culinary lore, a smattering of many other kinds of
knowledge, not only for the purpose of improving
his soups or ragouts, but in order, by the orations
he pronounced in praise of himself, to dazzle and
allure such persons as came to the agora in search
of an artist of his class. Of course the principal
source of his oratory lay among pots and frying-pans,
and the wonders effected by his art. Philemon
hits off with great felicity one of these worthies,
who desires to convey a lofty opinion of himself,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How strong is my desire ’fore earth and heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>To tell how daintily I cooked his dinner</div>
      <div class='line'>’Gainst his return! By all Athena’s owls!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>’Tis no unpleasant thing to hit the mark</div>
      <div class='line'>On all occasions. What a fish had I—</div>
      <div class='line'>And ah! how nicely fried! Not all bedevilled</div>
      <div class='line'>With cheese, or browned atop, but though well done,</div>
      <div class='line'>Looking alive, in its rare beauty dressed.</div>
      <div class='line'>With skill so exquisite the fire I tempered,</div>
      <div class='line'>It seemed a joke to say that it was cooked.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, just fancy now you see a hen</div>
      <div class='line'>Gobbling a morsel much too big to swallow;</div>
      <div class='line'>With bill uplifted round and round she runs</div>
      <div class='line'>Half choking; while the rest are at her heels</div>
      <div class='line'>Clucking for shares. Just so ’twas with my soldiers;</div>
      <div class='line'>The first who touched the dish upstarted he</div>
      <div class='line'>Whirling round in a circle like the hen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eating and running; but his jolly comrades,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each a fish worshiper, soon joined the dance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Laughing and shouting, snatching some a bit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some missing, till like smoke the whole had vanished.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet were they merely mud-fed river dabs:</div>
      <div class='line'>But had some splendid scaros graced my pan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Attic glaucisk, or, O saviour Zeus!</div>
      <div class='line'>Kapros from Argos, or the conger eel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which old Poseidon exports to Olympos,</div>
      <div class='line'>To be the food of gods, why then my guests</div>
      <div class='line'>Had rivalled those above. I have, in fact,</div>
      <div class='line'>The power to lavish immortality</div>
      <div class='line'>On whom I please, or, by my potent art,</div>
      <div class='line'>To raise the dead, if they but snuff my dishes!”<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c012'><sup>[804]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This honest fellow, in the opinion of Athenæus,
exceeded in boasting even that Menecrates of Syracuse,
who for his pride obtained the surname of
Zeus; he was a physician, and used vauntingly to
call himself the arbiter of life to mankind. He
is supposed to have possessed some specific against
epilepsy; but being afflicted with a vanity at least
equal to his skill, he would undertake no one’s
cure unless he first entered into an agreement to
follow him round the country ever after as his
slave, which great numbers actually did. Nicostratos,
of Argos, one of the persons so restored,
travelled in his train habited and equipped like
Heracles; others personated Asclepios, and Apollo,
while Menecrates himself enacted in this fantastic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>masquerade the part of Zeus; and, as the actors
say, he dressed the character well, wearing a purple
robe, a golden crown upon his head, sandals of the
most magnificent description, and bearing a sceptre
in his hand.<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c012'><sup>[805]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But whatever might have been the conceit of
our Syracusan physician, there were those among
the cooking race, who certainly lagged not far behind
him. They usually stunned such as came to
hire them with reciting their own praises, laying
claim to as much science and philosophy as would
have sufficed to set up two or three sophists. In
fact, to take them at their word, there was nothing
which they did not know, nothing which they
could not do. Painting they professed to comprehend
as profound connoisseurs, and, no doubt, the
soles they fried tasted all the better for the accomplishment.
In astronomy, medicine, and geometry,
they appear to have made a still greater proficiency
than Hudibras, notwithstanding that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In mathematics he was greater</div>
      <div class='line'>Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he by geometric scale</div>
      <div class='line'>Could take the size of pots of ale;</div>
      <div class='line'>Discern by sines and tangents strait</div>
      <div class='line'>If bread and butter wanted weight;</div>
      <div class='line'>And wisely tell what hour o’ the day</div>
      <div class='line'>The clock does strike by algebra.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In all this he was a fool to the Athenian cooks;
for, by the help of astronomy, they could tell when
mackerel was in season, and at what time of the
year a haddock is better than a salmon. From
geometry they borrowed the art of laying out a
kitchen to the best advantage, and how to hang
up the gridiron in one place, and the porridge-pot
in another. To medicine it is easy to see how
deeply they must have been indebted, since it not
only taught them what meats are wholesome, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>what not, but also enabled them by some sleight of
art to diminish the appetite of those voracious parasites,
who when they dined out appeared to have
stomachs equal in capacity to the great tun of
Heidelberg.<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c012'><sup>[806]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Many individuals, half guests, half parasites, used
to extract considerable matter for merriment out
of the dinner materials, that they might render
themselves agreeable, and be invited again. Thus
Charmos, the Syracusan, used to convert every dish
served at table into an occasion for reciting poetical
quotations or old proverbs, and sometimes, perhaps,
suffered the fish to cool while he was displaying
his erudition. He had always civil things to
say both to shell-fish and tripe, so that a person
fond of flattery might have coveted to be roasted,
in order that his shade might be soothed with this
kind of incense, which even Socrates allowed was
not an illiberal enjoyment. It was, however, a
common custom among parasites to make extracts
from the poets and carry them in portfolios to the
tables of their patrons, where they recited all such
as appeared to be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span>. In this way the above
Charmos obtained among the people of Messina the
reputation of a learned man, and Calliphanes,<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c012'><sup>[807]</sup></a> son
of Parabrycon,<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c012'><sup>[808]</sup></a> succeeded no less ingeniously by
copying out the first verses of various poems, and
reciting them, so that it might be supposed he
knew the whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cleanthes, of Tarentum, always spoke at table
in verse, so likewise did the Sicilian Pamphilos;
and these parasites, travelling about with wallets
of poetry on their backs, were everywhere welcomed
and entertained, which might with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>propriety have been adduced by Ilgen<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c012'><sup>[809]</sup></a> among
his other proofs of the imaginative character of the
Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archestratos, the Syracusan, belonged no doubt to
this class. He composed an epic poem on good eating,
which commenced with recommending that no company,
assembled for convivial enjoyment, should ever
exceed four,<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c012'><sup>[810]</sup></a> or at most five, otherwise he said
they would rather resemble a troop of banditti than
gentlemen. It had probably escaped him, that there
were twenty-eight guests at Plato’s banquet. Antiphanes,
after observing that the parasites had lynx’s
eyes to discover a good dinner though never invited,
immediately adds, that the republic ought to get up
an entertainment for them, upon the same principle
that during the games an ox<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c012'><sup>[811]</sup></a> was slaughtered some
distance from the course at Olympia, to feast the
flies, and prevent them from devouring the spectators.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides Archestratos, there were several other celebrated
gastronomers among the ancients. Of these
the principal were Timachidas, of Rhodes, who wrote
a poem in eleven books on good eating,<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c012'><sup>[812]</sup></a> Noumenios,
of Heraclea, pupil to the physician Dieuches,
Metreas, of Pitana, the parodist Hegemon, of Thasos,
surnamed the <em>Lentil</em>, by some reckoned among the
poets of the old comedy, Philoxenos, of Leucadia,
and a second Philoxenos, of Cythera, who composed
his work in hexameter verse. The former, after
chaunting the eulogium of the kettle, comes nevertheless
to the conclusion at last, that superior merit
belongs to the <a id='corr201.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fryingpan'>frying-pan</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_201.31'><ins class='correction' title='fryingpan'>frying-pan</ins></a></span>. He earnestly recommended
truffles to lovers, but would not have them touch the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>barbel. His anger burst forth with great vehemence
against those who cut in pieces fish which should
be served up whole; and, though he admits that a
polypus may occasionally be boiled, it was much
better, he says, to fry it. From this man the Philoxenian
cakes derived their name; and he it is whom
Chrysippos reproaches with half scalding his fingers
in the warm bath and gargling his throat with hot
water, in order that he might be able to swallow
kabobs hissing from the coals.<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c012'><sup>[813]</sup></a> He likewise used,
at the houses of his friends, to bribe the cooks to
bring up everything fiery hot, that he might help
himself before any one else could touch them. A
kindred gourmand, in the poet Krobylos, exclaims:
“My fingers are insensible to fire like the Dactyls
of Mount Ida. And ah! how delightful it is to
refresh my throat with the crackling flakes of
broiled fish! Oh I am in fact an oven, not a
man!”</p>

<p class='c001'>According to Clearchos it was this same Philoxenos,
who used to maraud about rich men’s houses,
followed by a number of slaves laden with wine,
vinegar, oil, and other seasonings. Wherever he
smelled the best dinner he dropped in unasked, and
slipping slily among the cooks, obtained their permission
to season the dishes they were preparing, after
which he took his place among the guests where he
fed like a Cyclops. Arriving once at Ephesos, by
sea, he found, upon inquiry in the market, that all
the best fish had been secured for a wedding feast.
Forthwith he bathed, and repairing to the house of
the bridegroom, demanded permission to sing the
Epithalamium. Every one was delighted; they could
do no less than invite him to dinner. And “Will
you come again to-morrow?” inquired the generous
host. “If there be no fish in the market,” replied
Philoxenos. It was this gourmand who wished
nature had bestowed on man the neck of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>crane that the pleasure of swallowing might be prolonged.<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c012'><sup>[814]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Pithyllos, another parasite, surnamed “the Dainty,”
not content with the membrane which nature has
spread over the tongue, superinduced artificially a
sort of mucous covering, which retained for a considerable
time the flavour of what he ate.<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c012'><sup>[815]</sup></a> To prolong
his luxurious enjoyment as much as possible,
he afterwards scraped away this curious coating with
a fish. Of all ancient gourmands he alone is said
to have made use of artificial finger-points, that he
might be enabled to seize upon the hottest morsels.
An anecdote so good as to have given rise
to many modern imitations, is related of Philoxenos,
of Cythera. Dining one day with Dionysios, of Syracuse,
he observed a large barbel served up to the
prince, while a very diminutive one was placed before
him. Upon this, taking up the little fish, he
held it to his ear and appeared to be listening attentively.
Dionysios, expecting some humorous extravagance,
made a point of inquiring the meaning
of this movement, and Philoxenos replied, that
happening just then to think of his Galatea,<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c012'><sup>[816]</sup></a> he
was questioning the barbel respecting her. But as
it makes no answer, said he, I imagine they have
taken him too young and that he does not understand
me. I am persuaded, however, that the old
fellow they have placed before your majesty must
know all about it. The king, amused by his ingenuity,
immediately sent him the larger fish which
he soon questioned effectually.<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c012'><sup>[817]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the Athenians were not reduced to depend
for amusement at table upon the invention of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>humble companions. They knew how, when occasion
required, to entertain themselves, and, in the
exuberance of their hilarity, descended for this purpose
to contrivances almost infantine. They posed
each other with charades, enigmas, conundrums, and,
sometimes, in the lower classes of society, related
stories of witches, lamias, mormos, and other hobgoblins
believed in by the vulgar of all nations.
Among persons engaged in public affairs the excitement
of political discussion was often, of course,
intermingled with their more quiet pleasures.<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c012'><sup>[818]</sup></a> But
with this we have, just now, nothing to do, nor
with the enigmas which we shall describe anon.
There was another and more elegant practice observed
by the Greeks at convivial meetings, which,
though not peculiar to them, has nowhere else, perhaps,
prevailed to the same extent,—I mean the introduction
of music and the singing of songs,<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c012'><sup>[819]</sup></a> light,
graceful, and instinct with wit and gaiety, to the
barbitos or the lyre.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the Greeks, generally, the love of music
and poetry seemed to be a spontaneous impulse of
nature. Almost every act of life was accompanied
by a song,—the weaver at his loom, the baker at
his kneading-trough, the reaper, the “spinners and the
knitters in the sun,” the drawer of water, even the
hard-working wight who toiled at the mill, had his
peculiar song, by the chaunting of which he lightened
his labour. The mariner, too, like the Venetian
gondolier, sang at the oar, and the shepherd and
the herdsman, the day-labourer and the swineherd,
the vintager and the husbandman, the attendant
in the baths, and the nurse beside the cradle. It
might, in fact, be said, that from an Hellenic village
music arose as from a brake in spring. Their
sensibilities were tremblingly alive to pleasure.
There was elasticity, there was balm in their atmosphere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and joy and freedom in their souls.—How
could they do other than sing?</p>

<p class='c001'>But, if music and poetry thus diffused their delights
over the industry of the laborious, it was
quite natural that where men met solely for enjoyment,
these best handmaids of enjoyment should not
be absent. Accordingly, we find that while the
goblet circulated, kindling the imagination, and unbending
the mind, the lyre was brought in and a
song called for. Nor was the custom of recent
date. It prevailed equally in the heroic ages, and,
like many other features of Greek manners, derived
its origin from religion. For, in early times, men
rarely met at a numerous banquet, except on occasion
of some sacrifice, when hymns in honour of the
gods constituted an important part of the ceremonies.
Thus Homer, describing the grand expiatory
rites by which the Achæan host sought to avert the
wrath of Apollo, observes, that they made great
feasts, and celebrated the praises of the god amid
their flowing goblets.<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c012'><sup>[820]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, though the theme of those primitive songs
may have been at first serious, it was, probably, not
long before topics better adapted to festive meetings
obtained the preference. At all events, they
soon came to be in fashion. The first step appears
to have been from the gods to the heroes, whose
achievements, being sometimes tinged with the ludicrous,
opened the door to much gay and lively description.
And these convivial pleasures,<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c012'><sup>[821]</sup></a> so highly
valued on earth, were, with great consistency, transferred
to Olympos, where the immortals themselves
were thought to heighten their enjoyments by songs
and merriment.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the ages following, the art of enhancing thus the
delights of social intercourse, so far from falling into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>neglect, grew to be more than ever cultivated. Even
the greatest men, beginning from the Homeric Achilles,
disdained not to sing. They did not, says a judicious
and learned writer, consider it sufficient to perform
deeds worthy of immortality, or to be the theme of
poets and musicians, or so far to cultivate their minds
as to be able to relish and appreciate the songs of
others, but included music within the circle of their
own studies, as an accomplishment without which no
man could pretend to be liberally educated. For this
reason it was objected by Stesimbrotos, as a reproach
to Cimon, that he was ignorant of music, and every
other gentlemanly accomplishment held in estimation
among the Greeks;<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c012'><sup>[822]</sup></a> and even Themistocles himself
incurred the charge of rusticity, because, when challenged
at a party, he refused to play on the cithara.<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c012'><sup>[823]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A different theory of manners prevailed among the
Romans, who, like the modern Turks, considered it
unbecoming a gentleman to sing. But to the Greeks,
a people replete with gaiety and ardour, and whose
amusements always partook largely of poetry, music
presented itself under a wholly different aspect, and
was so far from appearing a mean or sordid study,
that no branch of education was held in higher honour,
or esteemed more efficacious in promoting tranquillity
of mind, or polish and refinement of manners. The
lyre is accordingly said, by Homer, to be a divine
gift, designed to be the companion and friend of
feasts, where it proved the source of numerous advantages.
In the first place, persons too much addicted
to the bottle found in this instrument an ally against
their own failing, for, whether playing or listening,
a cessation from drinking was necessarily effected.
Rudeness also and violence, and that unbridled audacity
commonly inspired by wine, were checked by
music, which, in their stead, inspired a pleasing exaltation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of mind, and joy free from all admixture of
passion.<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c012'><sup>[824]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has already been observed that the convivial
song soon divested itself of its religious and sombre
character; for, as parties are made up of persons differing
extremely in taste and temperament, it necessarily
happened that when each was required to sing,
much variety would be found in the lays, which generally
assumed a festive and jocund air. Hymns in
honour of the gods were more sparingly introduced,<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c012'><sup>[825]</sup></a>
nor was much stress laid on the praises of heroes;<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c012'><sup>[826]</sup></a>
the spirit of joviality moulded itself into</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nods and becks, and wreathed smiles.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Every one poured forth what the whim of the moment
inspired,—jokes, love-songs, or biting satires,
with the freedom and fertility of an improvisatore.<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c012'><sup>[827]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These convivial songs were divided by the ancients
into several kinds, with reference sometimes to their
nature, sometimes to the manner in which they were
chaunted: the most remarkable they denominated Scolia,
or zig-zag songs,<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c012'><sup>[828]</sup></a> for a reason somewhat difficult of
explanation. Several of the later Greek writers appear
to have been greatly at a loss to account for
the appellation, which is, no doubt, a singular one;
but the learning and diligence of Ilgen<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c012'><sup>[829]</sup></a> may be
said to have fully resolved this curious question.
After determining the antiquity of the Scolion, which
Pindar<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c012'><sup>[830]</sup></a> supposes to have been an invention of Terpander,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>or, at least, the verses of the song, but which
Ilgen dates as far back as the heroic period, he observes,
that the name itself was known in very remote
ages, since they formed a separate class among the
works of Pindar, and are mentioned by Aristophanes
and Plato,<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c012'><sup>[831]</sup></a> and that, like the Cyclic chorus, it arose
out of the circumstances under which it was sung.
For as this chorus was called Cyclic, or circular, because
chaunted by persons moving in a circle round
the altar of Bacchos, so the Scolion, or zig-zag song,<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c012'><sup>[832]</sup></a>
received its name from the myrtle branch, or the
cithara, to which it was sung, being passed from one
guest to another in a zig-zag<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c012'><sup>[833]</sup></a> fashion, just as those
who possessed the requisite skill happened to sit at table.</p>

<p class='c001'>To render this explanation perfectly intelligible,
it will, perhaps, be necessary to describe succinctly
the whole process of singing in company. At first,
it has been conjectured, when manners were rude,
and the language still in its infancy, singing, like
dancing, required no great art, and was little more
than those wild bursts of melody still common among
the improvisatori of Arabia and other Eastern countries,
but that from these humble beginnings lyrical
poetry took its rise, preserving still the freedom of
its original state, and rising, unshackled by the rigid
laws of metre, to heights of sublimity and grandeur
beyond which no human composition ever soared.
By degrees some complex forms of verse obtained
the preference,—such, for example, as those of Sappho
and Alcæos,—and fixed and definite laws of metre
were established.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>The Scolion, however, always preserved something
of its original spontaneous character, at least in appearance,
and the same thing may be predicated of
all their festive lays. But before they gave loose to
their gaiety, the deep religious sentiment which pervaded
the whole nation required a pæan, or hymn,
to be sung in honour of the gods, and in this every
person present joined.<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c012'><sup>[834]</sup></a> While thus engaged, each
guest, it is supposed, held in his hand a branch of
laurel, the tree sacred to Apollo.<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c012'><sup>[835]</sup></a> To the pæan succeeded
another air, which all present sang in their turn,
holding this time a branch of myrtle,<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c012'><sup>[836]</sup></a> which, like
the laurel bough mentioned above, was called æsakos,
or the “branch of song.”<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c012'><sup>[837]</sup></a> The singing commenced
with the principal guest, to whom the symposiarch
or host delivered the Cithara<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c012'><sup>[838]</sup></a> and æsakos, demanding
a song, which, according to the laws of the table, no
one could refuse. Having performed his part, the
singer was, in turn, entitled to call upon his neighbour,
beginning on the right hand, and delivering to
him the Cithara and the myrtle branch. The second,
when he had sung, handed it then to the
third, the third to the fourth, and so on until the
whole circle of the company had been made. It
sometimes happened, though not often, that among
the guests an individual, unskilled in instrumental
music, was found, and, in this case, he sang without
accompaniment, holding the æsakos in his hand.<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c012'><sup>[839]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The poets who had the honour thus to cheer the
convivial hours of the Greeks were, in remoter times,
Simonides and Stesichoros, and, probably, Anacreon,
with others of the same grade;<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c012'><sup>[840]</sup></a> and, if we may
credit Aristophanes, songs were also selected from
the plays of Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>among ourselves from Shakespeare, Beaumont and
Fletcher, or Ben Jonson. It may even be inferred
that passages from Homer himself<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c012'><sup>[841]</sup></a> were sung on
these occasions; or, if not sung, they were certainly
recited by rhapsodists introduced for the purpose into
the assembly, who, holding a laurel branch while thus
engaged, probably gave rise to the practice of passing
round the myrtle bough. This branch, therefore,
whether of myrtle or laurel,<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c012'><sup>[842]</sup></a> constituted a part of a
singer’s apparatus. The latter was originally chosen
as sacred to Apollo, the patron of music, and because
it was also believed to be endowed with something
of prophetic power, the Pythoness eating its leaves
before she ascended the tripod, while it was the symbol
of ever-during song. Instead of the laurel,
myrtle was afterwards introduced, on account, probably,
of its being sacred to Aphrodite, whose praises
were celebrated in those amatory songs common at
feasts. It may, likewise, have been considered an
emblem of republican virtue, since Harmodios and
Aristogeiton concealed their swords in a myrtle
wreath.<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c012'><sup>[843]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To proceed, however, with the Scolia. These
lays, like the rest, made the circle of the company,
though not by passing in an unbroken series from
man to man, but, as has already been said, from one
skilful singer to another. In fact, the chanting of the
scolia was a kind of contest which took place when all
the other songs were concluded.<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c012'><sup>[844]</sup></a> The person who
occupied the seat of honour chanted to the Cithara
a song containing the praises of some mortal or
immortal, or the developement of some moral precept
or erotic subject, which was comprehended in
a small number of verses. When he had finished,
he handed the Cithara and myrtle, at his own discretion,
to some other among the guests, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>person thus challenged, who could not refuse without
passing for an illiterate clown, must at once take
up the same subject, and, without delay or premeditation,
break forth into a song in the same metre
and number of verses, if possible; and if unfamiliar
with the Cithara, he could sing to the myrtle. The
second singer now exercised his privilege and called
upon a third, who was expected to do as he had
done; so that very often the same idea underwent
five or six transformations in the course of the evening.
When the first argument had thus made the
circle of the company, he who concluded had the
right to start a new theme, which received the same
treatment as the first; so that sometimes, when people
were in a singing humour, air followed air, until
eight or ten subjects had received all the poetical
ornaments which the invention of those present could
bestow upon them.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to sing without wine would have been insipid.
I have said the chanting of the scolia
was a sort of contest, and, as he who contends and
obtains the victory looks naturally for a reward, so
the successful performer aspired to his, which, it
must be owned, was not inappropriate, consisting
of a brimming bowl, called <em>odos</em>, or the “cup of
song,” at once a mark of honour and a reward of
skill.<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c012'><sup>[845]</sup></a> All these particulars are inferable from the
examples of the scolion, which still remain; and
Aristophanes in the “Wasps,” presents something
like an outline, though dim and obscure, both of
the argument and the mode of execution. He imagines
a company of jolly fellows,<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c012'><sup>[846]</sup></a> such as Theoros,
Æschines, Phanos, Cleon, Acestor, and a foreigner
of the same kidney, and represents them as engaged in
performing certain scolia for their own entertainment.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the idea we should form of this kind of song
from the very comic passage in the “Wasps” differs
materially from the theoretic view of Ilgen, since
Philocleon constantly interrupts his son, terminating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>each sentence for him in a manner wholly unexpected,
and of course calculated to excite laughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>But though musical, the Greeks would not imitate
the grasshoppers,<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c012'><sup>[847]</sup></a> who are said to sing till they
starve; but, having accomplished the circle above-mentioned,
proceeded to other amusements which,
though too numerous to be described at length, must
not be altogether passed over. In the heroic ages
the discovery had not been made that rest after
meals is necessary to digestion, which in later times
was a received maxim, and accordingly we find
from the practice of the Phæacians,<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c012'><sup>[848]</sup></a> who, if an after-dinner
nap had been customary, would certainly have
taken it, that the men of those times, instead of
indulging in indolent repose out of compliment to
their stomachs, sallied forth to leap, to run, to wrestle,
and engage in other athletic sports, which by no means
appear to have impaired their health or their prowess.
As civilisation advances, however, excuses are found
for laying aside the habits of violent exercise. Science,
in too many cases, fosters indolence and pronounces
what is fashionable to be wise. But to
the race-course and the wrestling-ring, sedentary,
or at least indoor, pastimes succeed, and, instead
of overthrowing their antagonists on the palæstra-floor
or the greensward, men seek to subdue them
at Kottabos, or on the chess-board, or to ruin them
at the card-table or in the billiard-room.</p>

<p class='c001'>The play of Kottabos,<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c012'><sup>[849]</sup></a> invented in Sicily, soon
propagated itself, as such inventions do, throughout
the whole of Greece, and got into great vogue at
Athens, where the lively temperament of the people
inclined them to indulge immoderately in whatever
was convivial and gay. The most usual form of
the game was this,—a piece of wood like the upright
of a balance having been fixed in the floor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>or upon a stable basis, a small cross-beam was
placed on the top of it with a shallow vessel like
the basin of a pair of scales, at either end.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under each of these vessels stood a broad-mouthed
vase, filled with water, with a gilt bronze statue,
called Manes, fixed upright in its centre. The persons
who played at the game, standing at some
little distance, cast, in turn, their wine, from a
drinking-cup into one of the pensile basins, which
descending with the weight, struck against the head
of the statue, which resounded with the blow. The
victor was he who spilled least wine during the
throw, and elicited most noise from the brazen
head. It was, in fact, in its origin a species of
divination, the object being to discover by the
greater or less success obtained, the place occupied
by the player in his mistress’s affections. By an
onomatop&oelig;a the sound created by the wine in its
projection was called <em>latax</em>, and the wine itself
<em>latagè</em>. Both the act of throwing and the cup
used were called <em>ankula</em>, from the word which expresses
the dexterous turn of the hand with which
the skilful player cast his wine into the scales.<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c012'><sup>[850]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Our learned Archbishop Potter, who has not unskilfully
abridged the account of Athenæus, confounds
the above with the <em>kottabos katactos</em>, another
form of the game described both by Pollux and
Athenæus.<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c012'><sup>[851]</sup></a> In this the apparatus was suspended
like a chandelier from the roof. It was formed of
brass, and a brazen vessel, called the skiff, was
placed beneath it. The player, standing at a little
distance, with a long wand, struck one end of the
kottabos, which descending came in contact with
the skiff, or rather the manes within, and produced
a hollow sound. Occasionally the small vessels at
the extremity of the kottabos were brought down,
as in the former game, by having wine cast into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>them. Another variety required the skiff to be
filled with water, upon which floated a ball, an instrument
like the tongue of a balance, a manes,
three myrtle boughs, and as many phials. In this
the great art consisted in striking some one of these
with the kottabos, and whoever could sink most of
them won the game. The prize, on these occasions,
was usually one of those cakes called <em>pyramos</em><a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c012'><sup>[852]</sup></a> or
something similar; but instead of these it was sometimes
agreed, when women were present, that the
prize should be a kiss, as in our game of forfeits.
Another kind of kottabos, chiefly practised on those
occasions which resembled our christenings, when on
the tenth day the child received its name, was a
contention of wakefulness, when the person who
longest resisted sleep, won the prize. Properly, however,
kottabos was the amusement first described;
and so fashionable did it become, that persons erected
circular rooms expressly for the purpose, in order
that the players might take their stand at equal
distances from the apparatus which stood in the
centre.<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c012'><sup>[853]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It might, without any authority, be presumed that
when people met together for enjoyment they would
derive the greater portion of it from conversation,
which would, of course, vary and slide</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From grave to gay, from lively to severe,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>according to the character or fluctuating humour of
the company. The Spartans, like all military people,
were grievously addicted to jokes, which among them
supplied the place of that elegant badinage, alternating
with profound or impassioned discourse, familiar
to the more intellectual Athenians. The latter, however,
though free from the coarseness, possessed more
than the mirthfulness of the Dorians, and in the
midst of their habits of business and application to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>philosophy, knew better than any people how, amidst
wine and good-eating, to unbend and enjoy the luxury
of careless trifling and an unwrinkled brow.
While some therefore retired to the kottabos-room,
which occupied the place of our billiard-room, others
still sat clustered round the table, extracting amusement
from each other. Among these of course would
be found all such as excelled in the art of small
talk, who could tell a good story or anecdote, scatter
around showers of witticisms, or give birth to a
pun. Some, like the Spartans, had a Welsh passion
for genealogies, and loved to run back over the history
of the “Landed Gentry” of old Hellas, to the
time of Deucalion or higher; others coined their wisdom
and experience into fables, for which they exhibited
an almost Oriental fondness; while the greater
number, like the princes in the Arabian Nights,
exercised their wits in propounding and resolving
difficult questions, enigmas, charades, anagrams, and
conundrums.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the principal classes into which these contrivances
were divided were two: <em>enigmas</em> and <em>griphoi</em>,<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c012'><sup>[854]</sup></a>
the former comprehending all those terminating in
mere pleasure, the latter such questions and riddles
as involved within themselves the kernel of wisdom
or knowledge,<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c012'><sup>[855]</sup></a> supposed to have been a dull and serious
affair. Casaubon,<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c012'><sup>[856]</sup></a> however, vindicates it stoutly
from this charge, affirming that in the griphos the
<em>utile</em> was mingled with the <em>dulce</em> in due proportion;
so that it must, according to Horace’s opinion, have
borne away the palm from most literary inventions.
In point of antiquity, too, the riddle may justly
boast; for, if to be old is to be noble, it has “more
of birth and better blood” even than the hungry
Dorians of the Peloponnesos, whom Mr. Mitchell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>prefers, on this account, before all nations of Ionic
race. Like everything good also it comes from the
East. The earliest mention of the riddle occurs in
the book of Judges,<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c012'><sup>[857]</sup></a> where Samson, during his
marriage-feast at Timnath, perplexes his guests with
the following riddle:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came
forth sweetness;”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>To which they, being instructed by his wife, replied:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a
lion?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The word griphos, in its original acceptation, signified
a fishing-net, and hence by translation was
employed to describe a captious or cunningly contrived
question, in which the wits of people were
entangled.<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c012'><sup>[858]</sup></a> As the ancients delighted in this sort
of intellectual trifling they were at the pains to be
very methodical about it, dividing the riddle into
several kinds, which Clearchos of Soli<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c012'><sup>[859]</sup></a> made the
subject of a separate work. This writer, a sort of
Greek D’Israeli, defines the griphos to mean “a
sportive problem proposed for solution on condition,
that the discovery of the sense should be
attended by a reward, and failure with punishment.”
His description of the seven classes could
scarcely be rendered intelligible, and certainly not
interesting to the modern reader. It will be more
to the purpose to introduce two or three specimens,
prefacing them by a few remarks.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been above observed, that philosophical
truths were often wrapped up in these sportive problems,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>which purposely obscured, so as to afford but
dim and distant glimpses of the forms within, necessarily
exercised and sharpened the wit and induced
keen and persevering habits of investigation.
The reward also and the penalty had the same tendency.
A crown, an extra junket, and the applause
of the company, cheered the successful Œdipos, while
the lackwit who beat about the bush without catching
the owl, had to make wry faces over a cup of
brine or pickle. Theodectes, the sophist, a man distinguished
for the excellence of his memory, obtained
reputation as a riddle-solver, and denominated
such questions the “springs of memory.”<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c012'><sup>[860]</sup></a> But whatever
the interrogatories themselves may have been,
the reward, to which their solution often led, was
rather a source of forgetfulness, consisting of a goblet
of wine which, when no interpreter could be found,
passed to the propounder.<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c012'><sup>[861]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The riddle was of course a mine of wealth to the
comic poets, who could not be supposed to forego
the use of so admirable a contrivance to raise expectation
and beget surprise. But it is clear, from
the examples still preserved, that they oftener missed
than hit. Antiphanes’s griphoi on “bringing and not
bringing;” on the “porridge-pot;” on a “tart,” &amp;c.,
are poor things; but the following from the “Dream”
of Alexis is good:</p>

<p class='c014'>Antiphanes, in his Sappho, introduces a very ingenious
riddle, partly for the purpose of offering a
sarcastic explanation directed against the orators:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There is a female which within her bosom</div>
      <div class='line'>Carries her young, that, mute, in fact, yet speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make their voice heard on the howling waves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or wildest continent. They will converse</div>
      <div class='line'>Even with the absent, and inform the deaf.<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c012'><sup>[863]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The poet introduces the “Lesbian maid,” explaining
the riddle, and this passage of the Athenian
comic writer may be regarded as the original of
those fine lines in Ovid, which Pope has so elegantly
translated:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Heaven first taught <span class='fss'>LETTERS</span> for some wretch’s aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some banish’d lover, or some captive maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,</div>
      <div class='line'>Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,</div>
      <div class='line'>The virgin’s wish without her fears impart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Excuse the blush and pour out all the heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>And waft a sigh from Indus to the pole.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>By this time, however, the reader will probably
be of opinion, that we have lingered long enough
about the dinner-table and its attendant pastimes.
We shall therefore hasten the departure of the
guests, who after burning the tongues of the animals
that had been sacrificed, to intimate that whatever
had been uttered was to be kept secret, offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>libations to Zeus, Hermes, and other gods, and took
their leave, in ancient times before sunset; but afterwards,
as luxury and extravagance increased, the
morning sun often enabled them to dispense with
link-boys. Examples, indeed, of similar perversions
of the night occur in Homer and Virgil, but always
among the reckless or effeminate in the palaces of
princes, whence, in all ages, the stream of immorality
has flowed downward upon society to disturb
and pollute it. The company assembled at Agathon’s,
also, sit up all night in Plato; and Aristophanes
represents drunken men reeling home through
the agora by daylight.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VII. <br /> THE THEATRE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is far from being my purpose to repeat the
information which may be obtained from a hundred
authors on the rise and progress of scenic representation
in Greece. I shall, on the contrary, confine
myself chiefly to those parts of the subject which
others have either altogether neglected, or treated
in a concise and unsatisfactory manner. It would,
nevertheless, be beside my purpose to attempt the
clearing up of all such difficulties as occur in the
accounts transmitted to us of the Hellenic drama;
and, in fact, notwithstanding the laborious investigations
into which I have been compelled to enter,
I feel that there are many points upon which I can
throw no new light, and which appear likely for
ever to baffle the ingenuity of architects and
scholars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dionysos, being a deity connected with agriculture,
his worship naturally took its rise, and for a
long time prevailed chiefly, in the country. His
festivals were celebrated with merriment; and, the
power of mimicry being natural to man, the rustics,
when congregated to set forth the praise of their
tutelar god, easily glided into the enactment of a
farcical show. And dramatic exhibitions at the
outset were little superior to the feats of Punch,
though, so great was their suitableness to the national
character, that, in the course of time, every
town of note had its own theatre, as it had of old
its own dithyrambic bard;<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c012'><sup>[864]</sup></a> and dramatic writers were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>multiplied incomparably beyond what they have been
in any other country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both tragedy and comedy,<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c012'><sup>[865]</sup></a> properly so called,
took their rise in Attica, and there only, in the
ancient world, flourished and grew up to perfection.
The theatre, in fact, formed at length a part of the
constitution, and, probably, the worst part, its tendency
being to foster personal enmities, to stir the
sources of malice, and, while pretending to purge
off the dross of the passions by the channels of
sorrow and mirth, to induce habits of idleness and
political apathy, by affording in the brilliant recesses
of a mock world a facile refuge from the toils
and duties of the real one. Nevertheless, it may
be curious to open up a view into that universe of
shadows wherein the vast creations of Æschylus, of
Sophocles, of Euripides, of Aristophanes, and Menander
displayed themselves before the eyes of the
Athenians, with a costly grandeur and magnificence
never equalled save in imperial Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been already remarked, that to the Dionysiac
theatre of Athens the architectural speculations
of Vitruvius on dramatic edifices apply, this building
having constituted the model on which similar
structures were afterwards erected.<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c012'><sup>[866]</sup></a> By carefully
studying its details, therefore, we shall be enabled
to form a tolerably just conception of all the theatres
once found in Greece, though each, perhaps, may
have been slightly modified in plan, general arrangement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and decorations, by the peculiarities of the
site, and the science or taste of its architect.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great theatre of Bacchos, partly scooped out
of the rock on the face of the hill at the south-eastern
angle of the Acropolis, stretched forth, on
solid piers of masonry, a considerable distance into
the plain, and was capable of containing upwards
of thirty thousand people. The diameter, accordingly,
if it did not exceed, could have fallen little
short of five hundred feet.<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c012'><sup>[867]</sup></a> For we are not to suppose
that, while Sparta,<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c012'><sup>[868]</sup></a> and Argos, and Megalopolis,
cities comparatively insignificant, possessed theatres
of such dimensions, Athens, incomparably the largest
and most beautiful of Hellenic capitals, would have
been content with one of inferior magnitude.<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c012'><sup>[869]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To determine accurately the various parts of the
theatre, and thus affix a distinct meaning to every
term connected with it, has exercised the ingenuity
of critics and architects for the last three hundred
years, still leaving many difficulties to be overcome.
I can scarcely hope in every case to succeed where
they have failed. But the following explanation
may, perhaps, convey of its interior an idea sufficiently
exact for all practical purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Supposing ourselves to be standing at the foot
of the Katatomè,<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c012'><sup>[870]</sup></a> a smooth wall of rock, rising
perpendicularly from the back of the theatre to the
superimpending fortifications of the Acropolis, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>behold on either hand, surmounted by porticoes,
lofty piers of masonry projecting like horns down
the rocky slope into the plain and united at their
extremities by a wall of equal height, running in
a straight line from one point of the horseshoe to
the other. The space thus enclosed is divided into
three principal parts,—the amphitheatre for the
spectators, the orchestra,<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c012'><sup>[871]</sup></a> filling all the space occupied
by the modern pit, for the chorus, and the
stage, properly so called, for the actors. Each of
these parts was again subdivided. Looking down
still from the Katatomè, we behold the benches
of white marble, sweeping round the whole semicircle
of the theatre, descend like steps to the
level of the orchestra, and intersected at intervals
by narrow straight passages converging towards
a point below.<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c012'><sup>[872]</sup></a> A number of the upper seats,
cut off, by an open space extending round the
whole semicircle, from the rest, was set apart
for the women. Other divisions were appropriated
to other classes of the population, as the tier of
seats immediately overlooking the orchestra to the
senators, or dicasts, another portion to the youth,
another to foreigners and the guests of the state,
while the remainder was occupied by the dense mass
of citizens of all ages,<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c012'><sup>[873]</sup></a> with crowns of flowers on
their heads.</p>

<p class='c001'>Above the level of the most elevated range of
seats, and stretching round the whole sweep of the
edifice,<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c012'><sup>[874]</sup></a> arose a spacious portico,<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c012'><sup>[875]</sup></a> designed to afford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>shelter to the spectators during the continuance of
a sudden shower. Another range of porticoes extended
along the small lawn or grove within the
limits of the theatre, at the back of the stage, so
that there was little necessity for the Athenian
people to take refuge, as some have imagined, from
the weather in the public buildings, sacred or civil,
in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would appear from an expression in Pollux,<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c012'><sup>[876]</sup></a>
that the lower seats of the theatre, appropriated to
persons of distinction, were covered with wood,<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c012'><sup>[877]</sup></a>
notwithstanding which, it was usual, in the later
ages of the commonwealth, for rich persons to have
cushions brought for them to the theatre by their
domestics,<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c012'><sup>[878]</sup></a> together with purple carpets for their
feet. Theophrastus, accordingly, whom few striking
traits of manners escaped, represents his flatterer
snatching this theatrical cushion from the slave, and
adjusting and obsequiously smoothing it for his patron.<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c012'><sup>[879]</sup></a>
To render their devotion to Dionysos still less
irksome, it was customary to hand round cakes and
wine during the representation, though, like Homer’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>heroes, they were careful to fortify themselves
with a good meal before they ventured abroad. We
are informed, moreover, that when the actors were
bad there was a greater consumption of confectionary,
the good people being determined to make
up in one kind of enjoyment what they lost in
another. Full cups, moreover, were habitually
drained on the entrance and exit of the chorus.<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c012'><sup>[880]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The orchestra, being considerably below the level
of the stage, had in the middle of it a small square
platform, called the Thymele,<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c012'><sup>[881]</sup></a> sometimes regarded
as a bema on which the leader of the chorus mounted
when engaged in dialogue with the actors; sometimes
as an altar on which sacrifice was offered up to
Dionysos. That part of the orchestra which lay between
the Thymele and the stage was denominated
the Dromos, while the name of Parodoi was bestowed
on those two spacious side-passages,<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c012'><sup>[882]</sup></a> the
one from the east, the other from the west, at the
extremities of the tiers of seats which afforded the
chorus ample room for marching in and out in rank
and file, in the quadrangular form it usually affected.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the extremity of the orchestra a pier of masonry
called the Hyposcenion, adorned with columns
and statues, rose to the level of the stage, where
a most intricate system of machinery and decoration
represented all that was tangible to sense in
the creations of the poet. The stage was divided
into two parts; first, the Ocribas or Logeion,<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c012'><sup>[883]</sup></a>
floored with boards, and hollow beneath, for the
purpose of reverberating the voice; second, the
Proscenion,<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c012'><sup>[884]</sup></a> a broader parallelogram of solid stonework,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>necessary to support the vast apparatus of
machinery and decoration required by the character
of the Grecian drama. The descent from the stage<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c012'><sup>[885]</sup></a>
into the orchestra was by two flights of steps situated
at either extremity of the Logeion, at the
point where the Parodoi touched upon the Dromos.
Beyond the Proscenion arose the Scene,<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c012'><sup>[886]</sup></a> properly
so called, the aspect of which was constantly varied,
to suit the requirements of each successive piece.
In most cases, however, it represented the front of
three different edifices, of which the central one,
communicating with the stage by a broad and lofty
portal, was generally a palace. Sometimes, as in
the Philoctetes, this portal was converted into the
mouth of a cavern,<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c012'><sup>[887]</sup></a> opening upon the view, amid
the rocks and solitudes of Lemnos, while in other
plays it formed the entrance to the mansion of some
private person of distinction, but was always appropriated
to the principal actor. The building on
the right assumed in comedy the appearance of an
inn, through the door of which the second actor
issued upon the stage, while the portal on the left
led into a ruined temple, or uninhabited house. In
tragedy the right hand entrance was appropriated
to strangers, while on the left was that of the female
apartments, or of a prison.<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c012'><sup>[888]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the stage, in front of the doors, stood an
altar of Apollo Aguieus, and a table covered with
cakes and confectionary,<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c012'><sup>[889]</sup></a> which appears sometimes
to have been regarded as the representative of that
ancient table, on which, in the simplicity of Prothespian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>times, the solitary actor mounted when
engaged in dialogue with the chorus.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the stage was fitted up for the performance
of comedy, there stood near the house a painted scene
representing a large cattle-shed, with capacious double
gates, for the admission of waggons and sumpter oxen,
with herds and droves of asses, when returning from
the field. In the Akestriæ of Antiphanes,<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c012'><sup>[890]</sup></a> this rustic
building was converted into a workshop. Beyond
each of the side-doors on the right and left were two
machines,<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c012'><sup>[891]</sup></a> one on either hand, upon which the extremity
of the periactoi abutted. The scene on the
right represented rural landscapes, that on the left
prospects in the environs of the city, particularly
views of the harbour. On these periactoi,<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c012'><sup>[892]</sup></a> were represented
the marine deities riding on the waves,
and generally all such objects as could not be introduced
by machinery. By turning the periactoi
on the right, the situation was changed, but when
both were turned a wholly new landscape was placed
before the eye. Of the parodoi, or side-passages,
that on the right led from the fields, from the harbour,
or from the city, as the necessities of the play
required, while those arriving on foot from any
other part entered by the opposite passage, and,
traversing a portion of the orchestra, ascended the
stage by the flights of steps before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>The machinery<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c012'><sup>[893]</sup></a> by which the dumb economy of
the play was developed consisted of numerous parts,
highly complicated and curious. To avoid labour,
and, perhaps, some tediousness, these might be passed
over with such a remark as the above, but this would
be to escape from difficulties not to diminish them.
I shall descend to particulars.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, and most remarkable, was that machine called
an Eccyclema,<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c012'><sup>[894]</sup></a> much used by the ancients when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>scenes within-doors were to be brought to view.
It consisted of a wooden structure, moved on wheels,
and represented the interior of an apartment. In
order to pass forth through the doors, it was formed
less deep than broad, and rolled forth sideways, turning
round afterwards, and concealing the front of the
building from which it had issued. The channels
in the floor, which were traversed by the wheels,
doubtless concealed beneath the lofty basis, received
the name of Eiscyclema.<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c012'><sup>[895]</sup></a> Sometimes, as in the Agamemnon,
it presented to view “the royal bathing
apartment with the silver laver, the corpse enveloped
in the fatal garment, and Clytemnestra, besprinkled
with blood, and holding in her hand the
reeking weapon, still standing with haughty mien
over her murdered victim.”<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c012'><sup>[896]</sup></a> On other occasions a
throne, a corpse, the interior of a tent, the summit
of a building, were exhibited; and in the Clouds of
Aristophanes the interior of Socrates’ house was laid
open to the spectators, containing a number of masks,
gaunt and pale, the natural fruit of philosophy.<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c012'><sup>[897]</sup></a> It
should be remarked that the Eccyclema issued through
any of the doors, as the piece required the cells of
a prison, the halls of a palace, or the chambers of an
inn, to be placed before the eyes of the audience.</p>

<p class='c001'>That peculiar machine in which the gods made
their appearance,<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c012'><sup>[898]</sup></a> or such heroes as enjoyed the privilege
of travelling through the air,—Bellerophon,
for example, and Perseus,—stood near the left side-entrance,
and, in height, exceeded the stone skreen
at the back of the stage. This, in tragedy, was
denominated Mechanè, and Kradè in comedy,<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c012'><sup>[899]</sup></a>—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>this case resembling a fig-tree, which the Athenians
called Kradè. The watch-tower, the battlements, and
the turret, were constructed for the use of those
watchmen, such as the old man in the Agamemnon,
who looked out for signals, or indications of the coming
foe. The Phructorion<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c012'><sup>[900]</sup></a> was a pharos, or beacon-tower.
Another portion of the stage was the Distegia,
a building two stories high in palaces, from
the top of which, in the Phœnissœ of Euripides,<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c012'><sup>[901]</sup></a> Antigone
beholds the army. It was roofed with tiles,
(and thence called Keramos,) which they sometimes
cast down upon the enemy. In comedy, libertines
and old women, or ladies of equivocal character, were
represented prying into the street for prey from such
buildings.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Keraunoskopeion<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c012'><sup>[902]</sup></a> was a lofty triangular column,
which appears to have been hollow, and furnished
with narrow fissures, extending in right lines
from top to bottom. Within seem to have been a
number of lamps, on stationary bases, from which, as
the periactos whirled round, sheets of mimic lightning
flashed upon the stage from behind the scenes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The construction of the Bronteion,<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c012'><sup>[903]</sup></a> or thunder magazine,
I imagine to have been nearly as follows:—a
number of brazen plates, arranged one below another,
like stairs, descended through a steep, vaulted
passage behind the scene, into the bottom of a tower,
terminating in a vast brazen caldron. From the
edge of this, a series of metallic apertures,<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c012'><sup>[904]</sup></a> probably
spiral, pierced the tower wall, and opened without
in funnels, like the mouths of trumpets.</p>

<p class='c001'>When some deity was required to descend to earth
in the midst of lightning and sudden thunder, the
Keraunoskopeion was instantaneously put in motion,
and showers of pebbles from the sea-shore were hurled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>down the mouth of the Bronteion, and, rolling over
the brazen receptacles, produced a terrific crash,
which, with innumerable reverberations, was poured
forth by the Echeia upon the theatre.<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c012'><sup>[905]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In a lofty gallery called the Theologeion, extending
over the marble skreen at the back of the stage,
appeared the gods, when the drama required their
presence; and hence, I imagine, the Hebrew colony
which makes its appearance nightly near the roof
of our own theatres have obtained the name of gods.
Here Zeus, and the other deities of Olympos, were
assembled in that very extraordinary drama of Æschylus,
the Psychostasia, or weighing in the balance the
souls of Achilles and Hector.</p>

<p class='c001'>They employed in the theatre the machine called
a Crane,<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c012'><sup>[906]</sup></a> the point of which being lowered, snatched
up whatever it was designed to bear aloft into the
air. By means of this contrivance, Eos, goddess of
the dawn, descended and bore away the body of
Memnon, slain by Achilles before Troy. At other
times strong cords, so disposed as to resemble swings,
were let down from the roof, to support the gods
or heroes who seemed to be borne through the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though by turning the Periactoi three changes of
scene could be produced, many more were sometimes
required, and, when this was the case, new landscapes
were dropped, like hangings, or slided in frames in
front of those painted columns. These usually represented
views of the sea, or mountain scenery, or the
course of some river winding along through solitary
vales, or other prospects of similar character, according
to the spirit of the drama.</p>

<p class='c001'>The position of the Hemicycle is more difficult
to comprehend. It appears to have been a retreating
semicircular scene, placed facing the orchestra,
and masking the marble buildings at the back of
the stage, when a view was to be opened up into
some distant part of the city, or shipwrecked mariners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>were to be exhibited buffeting with the waves.
Not very dissimilar was the Stropheion,<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c012'><sup>[907]</sup></a> which
brought to view heroes translated to Olympos, or
on the ocean, or in battle slain, where change of
position with respect to the spectator was produced
by the rotatory motion of the machine.</p>

<p class='c001'>The position of the Charonian staircase,<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c012'><sup>[908]</sup></a> by which
spectres and apparitions ascended from the nether
world, is exceedingly difficult to be determined; but
that it was somewhere on the stage appears to me
certain, notwithstanding the seeming testimony of
Pollux to the contrary. The hypothesis which
makes the ghosts issue from a door immediately
beneath the seats of the spectators, and rush along
the whole depth of the orchestra, among the chorus
and musicians, is, at any rate, absurd. It must
have been somewhere towards the back of the
stage, near the altar of Loxios, the table of shew-bread
and those sacred and antique images which in
certain dramas were there exhibited. Here, likewise,
was the trap-door, through which river-gods
issued from the earth, while the other trap-door,
appropriated to the Furies, seems to have been situated
in the boards of the Logeion, near one of the
flights of steps leading down into the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c001'>The above synopsis of the machinery and decorations
employed by the Greeks in their theatrical
shows may, possibly, from its imperfection, suggest
the idea of a rude and clumsy apparatus. But, as
the arts of poetry, sculpture, painting, and architecture
reached in Greece the highest perfection, and,
as this perfection was coëtaneous with the flourishing
state of the drama, it is impossible to escape
the conviction, that the art of scene-painting
and the manufacturing of stage machinery, likewise,
underwent all the improvements of which by their
nature they are susceptible. For, in the first place,
it is not easy to suppose, that a people, so fastidious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>as were the Athenians, would have tolerated in the
theatre displays of ignorance and want of skill which
everywhere else they are known to have overwhelmed
with contempt and derision; more especially
as, in the first place, the landscapes and objects
represented were usually those with which they
were most familiar, though the fancy of the poet
sometimes ventured to transport them to the most
elevated and inaccessible recesses of Mount Caucasus,
to the summit of the celestial Olympos, to the
palaces and harems of Persia, to the wilds of the
Tauric Chersonese,<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c012'><sup>[909]</sup></a> or even to the dim and dreary
regions of the dead. The names, nevertheless, of
few scene-painters, besides Agatharchos,<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c012'><sup>[910]</sup></a> have come
down to us, though it is known, that, in their own
day, they sometimes divided with the poet the admiration
of the audience, and, on other occasions,
enabled poets of inferior merit to bear away the
prize from their betters.</p>

<p class='c001'>The character, however, of stage-scenery differed
very widely in tragedy, comedy, and satyric pieces,<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c012'><sup>[911]</sup></a>
usually consisting, in the first, of façades of palaces,
with colonnades, architraves, cornices, niches, statues,
&amp;c.; in comedy, of the fronts or courts of ordinary
houses, with windows, balconies, porticoes, &amp;c.;
while, in the satyric drama, the fancy of the painter
and decorator was allowed to develope before the
audience scenes of rural beauty remote from cities,
as the hollows of mountains shaded with forests,
winding valleys, plains, rivers, caverns, and sacred
groves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the Grecian actors,<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c012'><sup>[912]</sup></a> whose business and profession
next require to be noticed, too little by far
is known, considering the curious interest of the
subject. Their art, however, would appear to have
sprung from that of the rhapsodists, who chanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>in temples, during religious festivals, and afterwards
in the theatres, the heroic lays of Greece. To a
certain extent, indeed, the rhapsodist was himself
an actor. His art required him to enter deeply
into the spirit of the poetry he recited, to suit to
the passion brought into play the modulations and
inflexions of his voice, his tone, his looks, his gesture,
so as vividly to paint to the imagination the
picture designed by the poet, and sway the whole
theatre by the powerful wand of sympathy through
all the gradations of sorrow, indignation, and joy.<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c012'><sup>[913]</sup></a>
By some writers, accordingly, the rhapsodist is apparently
confounded with the actor, that is, he is
considered an actor of epics,<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c012'><sup>[914]</sup></a> though in reality his
imitations of character were partial and imperfect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Actors formed at Athens part of a guild, or company,
called the Dionysiac artificers,<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c012'><sup>[915]</sup></a> among whom
were also comprehended rhapsodists, citharœdi, citharistæ,
musicians, jugglers, and other individuals<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c012'><sup>[916]</sup></a>
connected with the theatre. These persons, though
for the most part held in little estimation, were yet
somewhat more respectable than at Rome, where to
appear on the stage was infamous.<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c012'><sup>[917]</sup></a> Like the rhapsodists,
they generally led a wandering life, sometimes
appearing at Athens,<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c012'><sup>[918]</sup></a> sometimes at Corinth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>or Sicyon, or Epidauros, or Thebes, after the fashion
approved among the strollers of our own day. In
the course of these wanderings they now and then
fell in with rare adventures, as in the case of that
company of comedians which, on returning from
Messenia towards the Isthmus, was met by king
Cleomenes and the Spartan army near Megalopolis.<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c012'><sup>[919]</sup></a>
To exhibit the superiority of his power and his contempt
for the enemy, Cleomenes threw up, probably
with turf and boards, a temporary theatre, where
he and his army sat all day enjoying the jokes and
wild merriment of the stage, after which, he bestowed,
as a prize, upon the principal performers, the
sum of forty minæ, or about one hundred and sixty
pounds sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>About this period, however, it was usual for the
armies of Greece, republican as well as royal, to be
followed by companies of strollers, jugglers, dancing
girls, and musicians.<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c012'><sup>[920]</sup></a> Even in the army of Alexander,
when proceeding on the Persian expedition,
the “flatterers of Dionysos”<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c012'><sup>[921]</sup></a> were not forgotten;
in fact, the son of Philip set a high value upon
the performances of these gentlemen, and with truly
royal munificence allowed them to enjoy their full
share of the plunder of the East. Thus, when Nicocreon,
king of Salamis, and Pasicrates, king of Soli,<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c012'><sup>[922]</sup></a>
played the part of Choregi in Cyprus, in getting up
certain tragedies there performed for the amusement
of Alexander, and the actors, Thessalos, and Athenodoros
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the Athenian, contended for the prize; he
was piqued at the victory of the Athenian, and,
though he commended the judges for bestowing the
prize on him whom they regarded as the best performer,
said, he would have given a part of his
kingdom rather than have beheld Thessalos overcome
by a rival.</p>

<p class='c001'>Afterwards, when Athenodoros was fined by his
countrymen for absenting himself from Athens during
the Dionysiac festival, evidently contrary to the statutes
in that case made and provided, Alexander paid
the fine for his humble friend, though he refused
to make application to the people for its remission.</p>

<p class='c001'>An anecdote related of Lycon of Scarphe, also
shows the high value set by the Macedonian prince
upon the amusements of the stage, and the influence
exercised over his mind by the Dionysiac artificers,
though, according to Antiphanes, he wanted
the taste to discriminate between a good play and
a bad one. The Scarpheote being one day in want
of money, as actors sometimes are, introduced into
the piece he was performing a line of his own
making, beseeching the conqueror to bestow on him
ten talents; Alexander, amused by his extravagance,
or captivated perhaps, by the flattery which accompanied
it, at once granted his request, and thus
upwards of two thousand four hundred pounds of
the public money were expended for the momentary
gratification of a prince.<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c012'><sup>[923]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The philosophers, almost of necessity, thought
and spoke of these wandering performers with extreme
contempt. Plato observes, that they went
about from city to city collecting together thoughtless
crowds, and, by their beautiful, sonorous, and
persuasive voices, converting republics into tyrannies
and aristocracies. Aristotle endeavoured to
account for their evil character and agency.<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c012'><sup>[924]</sup></a> They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>were worthless, he says, because of all men they
profited least by the lessons of reason and philosophy,
their whole lives being consumed by the study
of their professional arts, or passed in intemperance
and difficulties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, even among them there were different
grades, some aiming at the higher walks of
tragedy and comedy; while others were content
to declaim rude, low songs, seated on waggons like
mountebanks during the Lenæan festival.<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c012'><sup>[925]</sup></a> Nor
must this fashion be at all regarded as Prothespian,
since it prevailed down to a very late period.
And as in every thing the Greeks aimed at excellence
and distinction, so even here we find that
there was a contest between the poets who wrote
the comic songs sung by these humble performers
from their waggons.<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c012'><sup>[926]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The various classes of actors known to the ancients
were numerous. Among the lower grades were the
Magodos, and the Lysiodos,<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c012'><sup>[927]</sup></a> who though confounded
by some, appear clearly to have been distinct; the
former personating both male and female characters;
the latter female characters only, though disguised
in male costume. But the songs, and every other
characteristic of their performances, were the same.
The spirit of the coarse satirical farces they acted
forbids my explaining their nature fully.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were even several authors who attained a
“bad eminence” in this department of literature,
which especially affected the Ionic dialect, as Alexander,
the Ætolian,<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c012'><sup>[928]</sup></a> Pyretos of Miletos, a city noted
for its dissolute characters, and Alexos, who obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>on this account an opprobrious sobriquet. The most
remarkable, however, of this vicious brood would appear
to have been Sotades<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c012'><sup>[929]</sup></a> the Maronite, and his
son Apollonios who wrote a work on his father’s
poems. Sotades was probably the original imitated
by Pietro Aretino, who obtained in modern times a
like reputation, though timely penitence may have
snatched him from a similar end. The ancient libeller,
enacting the part of Thersites, fastened with
peculiar delight on the vices of princes, not from
aversion to their manners, but because such scandal
paved the way to notoriety. Thus at Alexandria,
he covered Lysimachos with obloquy, which, when
at the court of Lysimachos, he heaped upon Ptolemy
Philadelphos. His punishment, however, exceeded
the measure of his offences. Being overtaken in
the island of Caunos by Patrocles, one of Ptolemy’s
generals, the obsequious mercenary caused him to
be enclosed in a leaden box and cast into the sea.<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c012'><sup>[930]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Magodos, then, was a wandering farce actor,
not unlike the tumbling mountebanks one sometimes
sees in France and southern Europe. He
travelled about with an apparatus of drums, cymbals,
and female disguises, sometimes impersonating
women, sometimes adulterers or the mean servants
of vice; and the style of his dancing and performances
corresponded with the low walk he selected,
being wholly destitute of beauty or decorum. It
seems necessary, therefore, to adopt the opinion of
Aristoxenos, who considered the art of the Hilarodos
as a serious imitation of tragedy; that of the Magodos
as a comic parody, brought down to the level
of the grossly vulgar. The latter art would appear
to have derived its name from the charms, spells,
or magical songs chanted by the mountebanks who
likewise pretended to develope the secrets of pharmaceutics.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Superior in every way to the Magodos and Lysiodos
was the Hilarodos,<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c012'><sup>[931]</sup></a> who, though a wandering
singer like the Italians and Savoyards of modern
Europe, affected no little state, and was evidently
treated with some respect. His costume, in conformity
with the popular taste, displayed considerable
magnificence, consisting of a golden crown, white
stole and costly sandals, though in earlier ages he
appeared in shoes. He was usually accompanied by
a youth or maiden who touched the lyre as he sung.
The style of his performances was decorous and manly.
When a crown was given him in token of approbation
by the audience, it was bestowed on the
Hilarodos himself, not on the musician.</p>

<p class='c001'>A class of actors existed, also from very remote
times, among the Spartans. They were called Deikelistæ,<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c012'><sup>[932]</sup></a>
and their style of performing showed the
little value set upon the drama at Sparta. The
poetry of the piece, if poetry it could be called, was
extempore and of the rudest description, and the
characters were altogether conformable. Sometimes
the interest of the play turned upon a man robbing
an orchard, or on the broken Greek of an outlandish
physician, whom people respected for his gibberish.
This weakness, prevalent of course at Athens also,
is wittily satirised by Alexis in his Female Opium
Eater.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The Deikelistæ, however, were not confined to
Laconia, but, under various names were known
in most other parts of Greece. Thus, at Sicyon,
they obtained the appellation of Phallophori, elsewhere
they were called Autocabdali, or Improvisator;
while in Italy, (that is, among the Greek colonists,<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c012'><sup>[934]</sup></a>)
they were known by the name of Phlyakes.<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c012'><sup>[935]</sup></a>
By the common people they were called
the wise men (σοφίσται), upon the same principle that
actors in France are known by the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>artistes</i></span>.
The Thebans, renowned for the havoc they made in
the language of Greece, denominated them the Voluntaries,
alluding proleptically perhaps to the “voluntary
principle.” Semos, the Delian, draws an
amusing picture of these Improvisatori. Those performers,
he says, who are called Autocabdali made
their appearance on the stage, crowned with ivy,
and poured forth their verse extempore. The name
of Iambi was afterwards bestowed, both on them
and their poems. Another class who were called
Ithyphalli,<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c012'><sup>[936]</sup></a> wore those masks, which on the stage
were appropriated to drunkards, with crowns of
ivy and flowered gloves upon their hands. Their
chitons were striped with white, and over these,
bound by a girdle at the loins, they wore a Tarentine
pelisse descending to the ankle. They entered
upon the stage by the great door appropriated
to royal personages, and, advancing in silence
across the stage, turned towards the audience
and exclaimed,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Make way there, a wide space</div>

      <div class='line'>For Dionysos has a mind to walk</div>
      <div class='line'>Bolt upright through your midst.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The Phallophori made their appearance unmasked,
shading their face with a drooping garland of wild
thyme, intermingled with acanthus-leaves, and surmounted
by an ample crown of ivy, with violets
appearing between its glossy dark foliage. Their
costume was the caunacè. Of these actors, some
entered through the side-passages, others through
the central door, advancing with measured tread,
and saying,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bacchos, to thee our muse belongs,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of simple chant, and varied lays;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor fit for virgin ears our songs,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor handed down from ancient days:</div>
      <div class='line'>Fresh flows the strain we pour to thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Patron of joy and minstrelsy!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>After which, skipping forward, they made a halt
and showered their sarcasms indiscriminately on
whomsoever they pleased, while the leader of the
troop moved slowly about, his face bedaubed with
soot.<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c012'><sup>[937]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The superior classes of performers, whether actors
or musicians, seem to have been held in much estimation,
and to have been still more extravagantly
paid than in our own day. Thus Amœbæos, the
Citharœdos, who lived near the Odeion at Athens,
received, but at what period of the republic is not
known, an Attic talent a day, as often as he played
in public.<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c012'><sup>[938]</sup></a> Music, however, was always in high
estimation in Greece, where the greatest men, though
they did not seek to rival regular professors in skill,
yet learned to amuse their leisure with it. Thus
the Homeric Achilles plays on the lyre, the sounds
of which could not only cure diseases of the mind
but of the body. A similar belief existed among
the Israelites, as we learn from the example of
Saul.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though talent must have been always respected
in an actor, it appears to me that anciently they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>made comparatively little figure, while there were
great poets to excite admiration. But, afterwards,
when dramatic literature had sunk very low, the
actor usurped the consideration due to the poet, as
has long been the case in this country. They then
contended for the prize in the tragic contests,<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c012'><sup>[939]</sup></a> and
began to entertain a high opinion of their own
merits. In fact, the ignorant being better calculated
to feel than to judge, the actors often obtained
the first prizes in the games, and were held
in higher estimation than the poets themselves.<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c012'><sup>[940]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus persuaded of their own importance, they gradually
exercised over the poor devils who composed
plays for them, much the same tyranny as that in
our own age complained of by the poetical servants
of the theatre. That is, they despotically interfered
with the framing of the plot, with the succession
of the scenes, and procured episodes to be introduced,
in order that they might show off their
peculiar abilities. This is evident from a passage
in Aristotle’s Politics,<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c012'><sup>[941]</sup></a> where he observes that the
celebrated actor Theodoros would allow no inferior
performer to appear before him on the stage, knowing
the force of first impressions; from which it is
evident that the author was compelled to yield to
his caprice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Antiquity has preserved the names of many celebrated
actors, of whom several played a conspicuous
though sometimes a dishonourable part in the great
theatre of the world. Thus Aristodemos, who performed
the first character alternately with Theodoros,
became afterwards a traitor and betrayed the state
to Philip. Such too was the case with Philocrates
and Æschines, both actors,<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c012'><sup>[942]</sup></a> and both rogues. Satyros,
a comedian of the same period, appears to
have been a man of high character and honour, who
in consequence obtained the friendship of <a id='corr242.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Demosthenes'>Demosthenes.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_242.1'><ins class='correction' title='Demosthenes'>Demosthenes.</ins></a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>But the Garrick of that age seems to have
been Theocrines,<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c012'><sup>[943]</sup></a> who by many, however, is supposed
to have afterwards degenerated into a sycophant.
Callipedes is chiefly known to us from the anecdote
which describes the check his vanity received
from Agesilaos. Having acquired great reputation
as a tragic actor, he appears to have considered himself
as equal at least to any king, and therefore,
meeting one day with Agesilaos, he ostentatiously
put himself forward, mingled with the courtiers and
took much pains to attract his notice. Finding all
these efforts useless, his pride was wounded, and
going up directly to the Spartan, he said,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dost thou not know me, king?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why,” replied Agesilaos, “art thou not Callipedes,
the stage-buffoon?”<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c012'><sup>[944]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The account transmitted to us of Æsopos is somewhat
puzzling; he is described as one of the actors<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c012'><sup>[945]</sup></a>
who performed in the tragedies of Æschylus, but is
said to have been at the same time a fellow of infinite
merriment who turned everything into a jest,
a sort I suppose of comic Macbeth. Œagros obtained
celebrity in the part of Niobe,<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c012'><sup>[946]</sup></a> in the tragedy
of Æschylus or Sophocles; and Aristophanes
enumerates among the pleasures of Dicasts the power,
should such an actor appear before them in a court
of justice, of requiring him by way of pleading his
own cause, to give them a few choice speeches of
his favourite tragic queen.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the most celebrated actors of antiquity was
Polos, a native of Ægina, who studied the art of
stage-declamation under Archias, known in his own
age by the infamous surname of Phugadotheras, or
the “Exile <a id='corr242.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Hunter.'>Hunter.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_242.34'><ins class='correction' title='Hunter.'>Hunter.”</ins></a></span><a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c012'><sup>[947]</sup></a> This miscreant it was, who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>under the orders of Antipater, pursued Demosthenes
to the temple of Poseidon in Calauria, where, to escape
the cruelty of the Macedonians, the orator put
a period to his own life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Polos appears to have risen speedily to that eminence
which he maintained to the last. A striking
anecdote is related of the means by which he worked
upon his own feelings, in order the more vehemently
to stir those of his audience. On one occasion,<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c012'><sup>[948]</sup></a>
having to perform the part of Electra, he took along
with him to the theatre an urn containing the ashes
of a beloved son, whom he had recently lost, and thus,
instead of shedding, under the mask of the heroic
princess, feigned tears over the supposed remains of
Orestes, he sprinkled the urn which he bore upon
the stage with the dews of genuine and deep sorrow.
He eclipsed in reputation all the actors of
his time, and was in tragedy what Theocrines, in
the preceding age, had been in comedy. His salary,
accordingly, was very great, amounting at one
time to half a talent per day, out of which, to be
sure, he was required to pay the third actor.</p>

<p class='c001'>He must have led, moreover, a life of much temperance,
otherwise he would scarcely have been able
to accomplish what is related of him by Philochoros,
who says, that, at seventy years of age, a little before
his death, he performed the principal parts of eight
tragedies in four days. His devotion to his art did
not, however, carry him so far as that of the comic
poets, Philemon and Alexis, who breathed their last
upon the stage at the moment that the crown of
victory was placed upon their heads, and so were
literally dismissed for the last time from the scene
amidst the shouts and acclamations of the admiring
multitude.<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c012'><sup>[949]</sup></a> But the passion of the Greeks for the
arts of imitation did not confine itself to the enacting
of human character and human feelings. Every
species of mimicry found its patrons among them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>There were, for example, persons who, by whistling,
could imitate the notes of the nightingale; and
Agesilaos, being once invited to witness the performances
of one of these artists, replied somewhat
contemptuously, “I have heard the nightingale herself.”<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c012'><sup>[950]</sup></a>
Others, as Parmenion, could counterfeit to
perfection the grunt of a pig,<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c012'><sup>[951]</sup></a> though it is probable,
that actors of smaller dimensions were called upon
to perform in the comedy of Aristophanes, where
the Megarean<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c012'><sup>[952]</sup></a> brings on the stage his daughters in
a sack, and disposes of them as porkers, having first
carefully instructed them in the proper style of
squeaking. Other actors obtained celebrity<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c012'><sup>[953]</sup></a> through
their power of imitating by their voice the grating
or rumbling of wheels, the creaking of axletrees,
the whistling of winds, the blasts of trumpets, the
modulations of flutes, or pipes, or the sounds of
other instruments. It was customary, too, among
this class of performers, to mimic, doubtless, in pastoral
scenes, the bleating of sheep, and the bark
of the shepherd’s dog, the neighing of horses, and
the deep bellowing of bulls. They could imitate,
moreover, but by what means is uncertain, the pattering
of hail-storms, the dash and breaking of
water in rivers or seas, with other natural phenomena.
It was customary, likewise, as in modern
times, to introduce boats and galleys rowed along
the mimic waters of the stage, an example of which
occurs on an Etruscan Chalcidone, where we behold
a little vessel of extraordinary form, with a mariner
at bow and stern, paddled along a bank adorned
with flowers, while on a platform, occupying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>boat’s waist, two naked dancers are exhibiting their
saltatorial powers.<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c012'><sup>[954]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Very singular figures were also introduced upon
the stage, as wasps, frogs, and birds, of sufficiently
large dimensions to be enacted by men; and still
stranger personages occasionally made their appearance,
as where, in a kind of practical parody of the
story of Andromeda,<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c012'><sup>[955]</sup></a> a whale emerges on the sea
beach to snap off an old woman. In another drama
the transformation of Argos was represented, after
which this luckless male duenna strutted like a peacock
before the audience. Io, moreover, was changed
into a cow, and Euippe, in Euripides, into a mare.
What there was peculiar in the appearance of Amymone
it is not easy to conjecture; but she was, possibly,
represented in the act of withdrawing the trident of
Poseidon from the rock, from which gushed forth
three fountains. The rivers, and mountains, and cities
introduced<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c012'><sup>[956]</sup></a> were, doubtless, personifications, such as
we still find in many works of art. The giants
were simply, in all probability, huge figures of men,
made to stalk about the stage, like elephants, with
an actor in each leg; and the Indians, Tritons, Gorgons,
Centaurs, with other personages of terrible or
fantastic aspect, owed their existence, perhaps, to
masks, if we may so speak, representing the whole
figures.</p>

<p class='c001'>In what form the Seasons, the Pleiades,<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c012'><sup>[957]</sup></a> or the
nymphs of Mithakos, made their appearance on the
stage, we are, I believe, nowhere told, though we
possess some information respecting the costume and
figure of those other strange persons of the drama,
the Clouds,<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c012'><sup>[958]</sup></a> which came floating in through the Parodoi,
enveloped, some in masses of white fleecy gauze,
like vapour, others in azure, or many-tinted robes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>or in drapery like piled-up flocks of wool, to represent
the various aspects of the skies; while a hazy
atmosphere was probably diffused around them, as
around the other gods, by the smoke of styrax or
frankincense, burnt in profusion on the altars of the
theatre. Here and there, through these piles of
drapery, a mask with ruddy pendant nose, like the
tail of a lobster, peered forth, and a human voice
was heard chanting in richest cadence and modulation
the lively anapæsts of the chorus.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the tragedy of Alcestis, the grim, spectral figure
of Death was beheld gliding to and fro through the
darkness, in front of the palace of Admetos, while
personifications still, if possible, more strange and
wild, made their appearance in other dramas,—as Justice,
Madness, Frenzy, Strength, Violence, Deceit,
Drunkenness, Laziness, Envy.<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c012'><sup>[959]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Plato, who entertained peculiar notions<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c012'><sup>[960]</sup></a> respecting
the dignity of human nature, banished the theatre
from his Republic, because he thought it unbecoming
a brave man, who had political rights to watch over
and defend, to demean himself by low stage impersonations;
and, from his account of what he would
not have his citizens do, we learn what by others was
done. Sometimes, he observes, the actor was required
to imitate a woman, (though this task often
devolved upon eunuchs,) whether young or old, reviling
her husband, railing at and expressing contempt
for the gods, either puffed up by the supposed stableness
of her felicity, or stung to desperation by the
severity of her misfortunes and sorrows. Other female
characters were to be represented, toiling, or in love,
or in the pangs of labour; which shows that there
was scarcely an act or passage in human life not
occasionally imitated on the stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Slaves of course performed an important part in
the mimic world of the theatre; and with these,
Plato, by some unaccountable association of ideas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>classes smiths, and madmen, and vagabonds, and low
artificers of every kind, and the rowers of galleys, and
rogues, and cowards, below which his imagination
could discover nothing in human nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it was these very characters, with their low
wit, buffoonery, and appropriate actions, that constituted
the most effective materials of the comic poet,
whose creed was, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les fous sont ici-bas pour nos menus plaisirs.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>They accordingly hesitated at no degree of grotesque
buffoonery and extravagance, introducing not
only low sausage-sellers with their trays of black-puddings
and chitterlings suspended on their paunches,<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c012'><sup>[961]</sup></a>
and drunkards lisping, hiccuping, and reeling about
the stage,<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c012'><sup>[962]</sup></a> but even libertines and profligates carrying
on their intrigues in the view of the spectators.
An example of this kind of scene occurs on an
Etruscan bronze seal dug up near Cortona, which
represents an adulterer in conference with his mistress,
together with the Leno who brought them
together.<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c012'><sup>[963]</sup></a></p>

A taste for the amusements of
the Grecian stage was diffused
far and wide through the ancient
world, so that we find the princes
of Persia and Armenia not only
enjoying the representation of
Greek tragedies, but themselves,
likewise, in some instances, aspiring
to rival the dramatic poets
of Hellas. Thus Artavasdes, the
Armenian prince, is said to have
written tragedies, as well as histories
and orations, some of which
still existed in the age of Plutarch.
The Parthian court was
engaged in beholding the Bacchæ
of Euripides, in which Jason of
Tralles was the principal performer,
when Sillaces brought in
the head of Marcus Crassus,
upon which both king and nobles
delivered themselves up to immoderate
joy, and the actor, seizing
upon the Roman’s head, exchanged
the part of Pentheus for
that of his mother, who appears
upon the stage bearing a bleeding
head upon her thyrsus; for this
he received a present of a talent
from the king.—Plut. Crass. §

This philosopher, it is
clear, entertained a less elevated
idea of art than some modern
writers, who define it as follows:
“Art is a representation (μίμησις),
i. e. an energy by means
of which a subject becomes an
object,”—(Müller, cited by Mr.
Donaldson, Theatre of the Greeks,
p. 4,)—in other words, by which
a nominative becomes an accusative.</p>

<p class='c011'>Into the various questions which have been raised
respecting the origin and constitution of the chorus
it is not my intention to enter. It undoubtedly appears,
however, to have arisen amid the festivities
of the vintage, when, after the grapes were brought
home and pressed and the principal labours of the
season concluded,<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c012'><sup>[964]</sup></a> the rustics delivered themselves
up to wild joy and merriment, chanting hymns and
performing dances in honour of Dionysos, the protecting
god of the vine. At first the number of
the persons engaged in these dances could not have
been fixed, since it is probable that all the vintagers,
both male and female, joined in the sports,
as they had previously joined in the labour. And
this free and unformal character the Dithyrambic or
Dionysiac chorus must have preserved, as long as it
remained a mere village pastime. But when afterwards,
advancing from one step to another, it assumed
something of an artificial form and several chorusses
arose which contended with each other for a prize,
the performers must have undergone some kind of
training,<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c012'><sup>[965]</sup></a> both in singing and dancing, and then
the number of the individuals constituting the chorus
was possibly fixed. There appears to be some
reason for thinking, that these exhibitions were more
ancient than the congregation of the Athenians in
one city, and that originally every tribe had its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>chorus,<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c012'><sup>[966]</sup></a> since we find that afterwards, when all the
inhabitants of Attica came to regard themselves as
one people, the Choreutæ were chosen from every
tribe five.</p>

<p class='c001'>By what gradations, however, the village chorus
was transformed into the Dithyrambic, the Dithyrambic
into the Satyric, and the Satyric again into
the Tragic, it now appears impossible to ascertain;
but it seems to be quite clear,<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c012'><sup>[967]</sup></a> that in many ancient
tragedies the number of the chorus was fifty,<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c012'><sup>[968]</sup></a>
as, for example, in the “Judgment of the Arms,”
by Æschylus, in which silver-footed Thetis appeared
upon the stage accompanied by a train of fifty
Nereids.<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c012'><sup>[969]</sup></a> Again, according to certain ancient authors,<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c012'><sup>[970]</sup></a>
in the Eumenides of Æschylus, the chorus
of Furies at first amounted to fifty, which, rushing
tumultuously, with frightful gestures and horrid
masks,<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c012'><sup>[971]</sup></a> into the orchestra, struck so great a terror
into the people, particularly the women<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c012'><sup>[972]</sup></a> and children,
that their number was afterwards reduced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>law. I am aware that several distinguished scholars
think very differently on this subject; some maintaining,
that the chorus of Furies always consisted
of fifteen, while others reduce their number to three.
But, though both these opinions have been supported
with much learning and ingenuity, it seems difficult
to admit either the one or the other. In the
first place, since every thing connected with the
stage was in a state of perpetual fluctuation, since
the masks and costume were repeatedly altered,
since the number of the actors was augmented,
since almost every arrangement of the theatre, and
every characteristic of the poetry, underwent numerous
modifications; the chorus, also, it is probable,
submitted to the same alterations or reforms till
it settled in that tetragonal figure<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c012'><sup>[973]</sup></a> and determinate
number which it afterwards preserved, as long
as the legitimate drama existed in Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>In one point of view the history of the chorus
is extremely remarkable. At first, and for some
time, it constituted in itself the whole of the spectacle
exhibited at the Dionysiac festivals, where its
songs and dances, accompanied by such rude music
as the times afforded, satisfied the demands of the
popular taste, and were consequently supposed to
be everything that the god required. By degrees,
as experience suggested improvements either in the
music, in the manner of dancing, or in the materials
and composition of the odes, the movements,
singing, and appearance of the Chorus, assumed a
more artificial form, which was necessarily carried
forward many steps in the career of amelioration
by the institution of rival bodies of Choreutæ, who,
from the natural principle of emulation, endeavoured
to excel each other. Next, a detached member
of its own body, mounted on a table, enacted the
part of a stranger or messenger come to announce
something which it imported the servants of Dionysos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>to know. This table was doubtless placed
directly in front of the altar of Bacchos, on the
steps of which the leader of the chorus was probably
mounted in after ages, to hold communication
with the stranger; and, as this altar ripened
through many gradations into the Thymele, so the
aforesaid table rose through innumerable changes
into the Logeion. It may be remarked, moreover,
that the slope of a hill,<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c012'><sup>[974]</sup></a> when any such existed
near the village, would naturally be chosen on such
occasions to afford the peasants an opportunity of
standing behind each other on ascending levels, and
thus, without inconvenience, beholding the show;
and where such natural aid did not present itself,
they probably threw up embankments of turf in the
semicircular form, which experience proved to be
most convenient, and, out of this rude contrivance,
grew those vast and magnificent structures, which
afterwards constituted one of the noblest ornaments
of Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>The single actor, detached in the manner we have
said from the Chorus, speedily acquired greater importance,
and the aid of poetry was called in to
frame and adorn his recitals; and as, during the
songs and dances of the Chorus, he necessarily remained
idle, the idea soon suggested itself that a
second actor<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c012'><sup>[975]</sup></a> would be an improvement, upon which
dialogue and the regular drama sprang into existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the principal duties of the Chorus was the
performance of certain dances, simple enough at the
outset, but, in process of time, refined and rendered
so intricate by art, that it required no little learning
and ability to execute all their varied movements
with dignity and grace. Somewhat to assist the eye
and memory, the whole pattern, as it were, of the
dance seems to have been chalked out on the floor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of the orchestra;<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c012'><sup>[976]</sup></a> while the greatest possible pains
were taken in drilling the Choreutæ to open, file
off, and wheel through their labyrinthine evolutions,
without confusion. The manner in which these persons
usually entered the orchestra, that is to say,
ranged in a square body, three in front and five
deep, or five in front and three deep, has suggested
to some the notion that they represented a military
Lochos;<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c012'><sup>[977]</sup></a> but besides that this is inconsistent with
their Dionysiac origin, they did not always preserve
this arrangement, but, on some occasions, came rushing
in confusedly, while on others they traversed the
Parodos in Indian file.</p>

<p class='c001'>The musicians,<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c012'><sup>[978]</sup></a> in the Greek theatre, took their
station upon and about the steps of the Thymele,
which answers as nearly as possible to the position
of the orchestra in our own theatres. Here, also,
stood the Rhabduchi,<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c012'><sup>[979]</sup></a> or vergers of the theatre, whose
business it was to see that order was preserved among
the spectators.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the dances<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c012'><sup>[980]</sup></a> performed by the
Chorus, they were so numerous, long, and intricate,
that it would be here impossible to enumerate and
describe the whole. They appear to have conceived
the idea of representing almost every passion and
action in human life by that combination of movements
and gestures which the term pantomime, borrowed
from their own language, expresses much better
than our word dancing.<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c012'><sup>[981]</sup></a> A taste, in some respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>similar, still prevails among the Orientals,
whose Ghawazi and Bayadères, though relying rather
upon routine and impulse than on the resources of
art, perform at festivals and marriages, and before
the ladies of the harem, little love-pieces and pastoral
scenes, which evidently belong to the class of mimetic
dances described by ancient authors.</p>

<p class='c001'>In tragedy, such as it existed in the polished ages
of Greece, the movements were slow and solemn,
and, no doubt, full of dignity. The spirit of comedy
required brisk and lively, and frequently tolerated,
audaciously wanton dances; while the Chorus of the
Satyric Drama would appear to have been rude and
clownish rather than indecent, indulging in grotesque
movements, ludicrous and extravagant gestures, and
that rustic and farcical style of mimicry which may
be supposed to have prevailed among the rough
peasantry of Hellas.</p>

<p class='c001'>In classing the various dances, it will, perhaps, be
sufficient if we divide them into lively and serious,<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c012'><sup>[982]</sup></a>
joining with the latter all such as attempted to
embody a symbol or an allegory.</p>

<p class='c001'>In certain dramas of Phrynichos the Chorus represented
a company of wrestlers,<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c012'><sup>[983]</sup></a> who contrived by the
quick, flexible, and varied movements of the dance,
to imitate all the accidents of the palæstra. Sometimes
they personated a party of scouts in the active
look-out for the enemy, each with his right hand curved
above the brow: this was one form of the Scops.<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c012'><sup>[984]</sup></a> On
other occasions the dancer mimicked the habits of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Scops, or mocking-owl, twirling about the head, and
appearing to be absorbed in an ecstasy of imitation, until
taken by the fowler. The performance of a piece like
this, by a numerous Chorus, sometimes breaking off
into a brisk gallopade, sometimes maintaining the same
position, jigging, pirouetting, and ducking the crest,
must, no doubt, have appeared infinitely comic; and
yet it could have been nothing in comparison with
the Morphasmos,<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c012'><sup>[985]</sup></a> in which, not the characteristic peculiarities
of a single owl, but those of the whole
animal creation were “taken off.” Thus we may
suppose that the Hegemon of the Chorus started as
a baboon, his next-door neighbour as a hog, a third
as a lion, a fourth as an ass, and so on, each man
accommodating his voice to the character he had,
pro tempore, assumed, and gibbering, grunting, roaring,
braying, as he leaped, or gamboled, or bounded,
or scampered about the orchestra. Anon the frisky
foresters were transformed into slaves, who would seem
to have been introduced to the audience pounding
something, perhaps onions and garlick, in a mortar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Oclasma,<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c012'><sup>[986]</sup></a> a dance borrowed from the Persians,
reminds one strongly of the performances of the negroes
in the interior of Africa, the whole Chorus
alternately crouching upon its heels, and springing
aloft, like the frogs of Aristophanes about the fens
of Acheron. Not, perhaps, un-akin to this, were
those three frenzied dances, alluded to rather than
described by the ancients,—that is to say, the
Thermaustris,<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c012'><sup>[987]</sup></a> which seems to have consisted of a
series of violent bounds, like the performances of
the Hurons and Iroquois;<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c012'><sup>[988]</sup></a> the Mongas, which, from
the name, probably represented the friskings and caracollings
of a jackass; and the Kernophoros,<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c012'><sup>[989]</sup></a> or dance
of the first-fruits, wherein the Chorus appeared upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the stage, some bearing censers, others fruit-baskets,
evidently in a character resembling that of Bacchanals.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this species of dance belonged, also, the Hecaterides,
in which the performer interpreted his desires
or passion by furious gestures of the hands. The
Eclactisma was a female dance,<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c012'><sup>[990]</sup></a> requiring the exertion
of great force and agility, its characteristics
consisting in flinging the heels backwards above the
level of the shoulders. Corresponding, in some measure,
to the Eclactisma, was the Skistas,<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c012'><sup>[991]</sup></a> in which
the dancer bounded aloft, crossing his legs several
times while in the air. There was a dance, evidently
of a very extraordinary description, which they performed
to an air called Thyrocopicon,<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c012'><sup>[992]</sup></a> or “knocking
at doors,” possibly representing the frolics of such
wild youths as anticipated the scape-graces of our
own day. The Mothon was a loose dance, common
among sailors; the Baukismos, Bactriasmos, Apokinos,
Aposeisis, and Sobas,<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c012'><sup>[993]</sup></a> were laughable, but
lewd dances,<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c012'><sup>[994]</sup></a> resembling the Bolero and Fandango
of the Spaniards.<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c012'><sup>[995]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Heducomos was a dance expressive of the
outbreaks of joy, and the Knismos,<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c012'><sup>[996]</sup></a> represented the
pinching, struggling, and quarrels of lovers. The
Deimalea was a Laconian dance performed by Satyrs
and Seileni, skipping and jumping about in a
circle.<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c012'><sup>[997]</sup></a> Another Spartan dance<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c012'><sup>[998]</sup></a> was the Bryallika,
of a ludicrous and licentious character, performed
by women in grotesque masks, whence a courtezan
at Sparta was denominated, Bryallika. The name
of Hypogypones,<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c012'><sup>[999]</sup></a> was bestowed on certain performers
who imitated old men, flourishing their sticks about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the stage, as we are informed they did in the
play of Simermnos.<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c012'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> Akin in spirit to these were
the Gypones,<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c012'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> who made their appearance in transparent
Tarentine robes, and mounted on stilts probably
in the form of goats’ feet, to give them a
resemblance to the Ægipanes, worshipped as gods
of the woods. A peculiar dance in honour of Artemis
took its rise in the village of Carya in Laconia,
where its invention was attributed to Castor and
Polydeukes. No description of it, so far as I know,
has come down to us; but the maidens by whom it
was performed probably bore, and steadied with one
hand, a basket of flowers on their heads, thus forming
the model of those architectural figures, still
from them called Caryatides.<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c012'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> The representation
of this performance was, doubtless, a favourite subject
among Spartan artists or such as were employed
by the Spartans, as may perhaps be fairly inferred
from the circumstance, that the device on the ring,
which, in return for a comb, was presented by Clearchus
to Ctesias to be shown to his friends at Lacedæmon,
was a dance of Caryatides.<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c012'><sup>[1003]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Amid the laxity of morals which prevailed in the
later ages of Greece, the Pyrrhic,<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c012'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> once supposed to
be peculiar to warriors, degenerated into a dance of
Bacchanals, with thyrsi instead of spears, or carrying
torches in one hand, while with the other they
sportively cast light reeds at one another. The story
told in this mimetic performance referred to remote
antiquity, and was both curiously and elaborately
intricate, comprehending all the adventures of Bacchos
and his merry crew during the Indian expedition,
and assuming towards the conclusion a tragical
form, developing the sad story of Pentheus.<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c012'><sup>[1005]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the dances of a grave character are enumerated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>the Gingra performed like the Podismos
to slow and solemn music, the Lion and the Tetracomos,<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c012'><sup>[1006]</sup></a>
a warlike measure performed in honour of
Heracles and supposed in its origin to have had
some connexion with the Tetracomoi of Attica, that
is, the Peiræeus, Phaleron, Oxypeteones, and Thymotadæ.<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c012'><sup>[1007]</sup></a>
We read, moreover, of dances in which the performers
represented certain historic or mythological
personages, such as Rhodope, Phædra, or Parthenope.<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c012'><sup>[1008]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Anthema,<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c012'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> or Flower-dance, appears to have
been chiefly performed in private parties by women,
who acted certain characters and chanted, as they
moved, the following verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Where is my lovely parsley, say?</div>
      <div class='line'>My violets, roses, where are they?</div>
      <div class='line'>My parsley, roses, violets fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>are my flowers? Tell me where.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Athenians, however, seem to have imagined
that there was nothing in nature which might not
be imitated in the dance, by the turns and mazes
of which they accordingly sought to represent the
movements of the stars.<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c012'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> A similar fancy, if Lucian
may be credited, possessed the Indian Yoghis,
who every morning and evening before their doors
saluted the sun, at his rising and setting, with a
dance resembling his own,<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c012'><sup>[1011]</sup></a> which, as that luminary
no otherwise dances than by turning on its axis,
must have been a performance resembling that of
the whirling derwishes, whose broad symbolical petticoats
are meant, I presume, to represent the disk of
the sun. But the dance most difficult of comprehension
is that upon which they bestowed the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>κόσμου εκπύρωσις,<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c012'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> or the “Conflagration of the World.”
Of the figure and character of this performance antiquity,
I believe, has left us no account, though it probably
represented, by a train of allegorical personages
and movements, the principal events which, according
to the Stoics, are to precede the delivering up of the
Universe to fire.<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c012'><sup>[1013]</sup></a> Scaliger,<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c012'><sup>[1014]</sup></a> who does not attempt to
explain this strange exhibition, observes, however,
pertinently, that it was a dance in which Nero might
have figured, his burning of Rome deserving in some
sort to be regarded as a rehearsal of this piece.</p>

<p class='c001'>There existed among the Spartans<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c012'><sup>[1015]</sup></a> an elegant
dance denominated Hormos, or the Necklace, performed
by a chorus of youths and virgins who moved
through the requisite evolutions in a row. The line
was headed by a young man who executed his part
in the firm and vigorous steps proper to his age,
and which he would afterwards be expected to preserve
in the field of battle. A maiden immediately
followed, but, instead of imitating his masculine manner,
confined herself to the modest graceful paces and
gestures of her sex, and this alternation and interweaving,
as it were, of force and beauty, suggesting
the idea of a necklace composed of many coloured
gems, gave rise to the appellation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The dance of the Crane,<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c012'><sup>[1016]</sup></a> among the Athenians,
in some respects resembled the above. It was, according
to tradition, first invented by Theseus, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>landing at Delos on his return from Crete, offered
sacrifice to Apollo and dedicated the statue of Aphrodite
which he had received from Ariadne, after which
he joined the young men and women whom he had
delivered, in performing a joyous dance<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c012'><sup>[1017]</sup></a> about the
altar of Horns erected by Apollo, from the spoils
of his sister’s bow. The Choreutæ, engaged in executing
the Geranos, or Crane, formed themselves
into one long line with a leader in van and rear,
and then, guided by the design on the floor of
the orchestra, described by their movements the
various mazes and involutions of the Cretan labyrinth,
until, having traversed all its intricate passages,
they emerged at once, like their great countryman
and his companions, into light and safety. Other
dances there were, which, however curious they may
have been, cannot now be described from the scanty
materials left us: such were the dance of Heralds,
or Messengers, the dance of the Lily,<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c012'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> the Chitonea,
the Pinakides, the dance of the Graces,<a id='r1019' /><a href='#f1019' class='c012'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> and that
of the Hours, in which the performers floated about
with a circle of light drapery held over the head by
both hands.<a id='r1020' /><a href='#f1020' class='c012'><sup>[1020]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If from the dances we now pass to the Choreutæ,<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c012'><sup>[1021]</sup></a>
by whom they were performed, we shall
find that they generally made their appearance in
the orchestra with golden crowns upon their heads,
and habited in gorgeous raiment, frequently interwoven
or embroidered with gold.<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c012'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> The Chorus,
however, like the actors, must have constantly varied
its costume, to suit the exigencies of the
drama; sometimes to perform the part of senators,
sometimes of Nereids, sometimes of female suppliants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>sometimes of urn-bearers, sometimes of clouds,
or wasps, or birds. When in the tragedy of Æschylus
they were required to personate the Furies,
their exterior was the most frightful that can well
be imagined,—their long but scanty robes consisting,
as has been conjectured, of black lamb-skins,
slit up below and exposing their tawny withered
limbs to sight, while their blood-stained eyes, livid
tongue hanging out, and hair like a mass of knotted
serpents, easily accredited the belief of their being
infernal existences. Thus habited, with fingers terminating
in black claws,<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c012'><sup>[1023]</sup></a> and grasping a burning
torch, they burst upon the view of the spectators,
like so many hideous phantoms conjured up by an
imagination diseased with terror.</p>

<p class='c001'>The costume of the actors,<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c012'><sup>[1024]</sup></a> which some modern
writers suppose to have been extremely monotonous,<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c012'><sup>[1025]</sup></a>
was in reality, however, as rich, varied, and
characteristic as the masks of which we shall presently
have to speak. Gods, heroes, kings, chiefs,
soothsayers, heralds, rustics, the hetairæ, and their
mothers; gay youths, flatterers, libertines, procurers,
cooks, satyrs, slaves, &amp;c., had each and all their
appropriate dresses and ornaments, modified, no
doubt, from time to time by the change in public
taste, and the fancy of the poets. The divinities
had almost to be wholly framed by the Dionysiac
artificers. Conceived to be of superhuman stature,
it was necessary that the actors who represented
them should, in the first place, be lifted up on Cothurni,<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c012'><sup>[1026]</sup></a>
or half-boots, the soles of which were many
inches high,<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c012'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> their limbs and bodies were enlarged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>by padding, their arms lengthened by gloves, while
their countenances, which might be ignoble or even
ugly, were concealed by masks of exquisite ideal
beauty, rising above the stately forehead in a mass
of curls, which at once corresponded with the nobleness
of their features and augmented their colossal
height: add to all this robes of purple, or
scarlet, or azure, or saffron, or cloth of gold, floating
about the person in graceful folds, and training
along the floor, and we have some faint idea of
the celestial personages who with gemmed sceptres
and glittering crowns made their appearance on the
Grecian stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The queens and heroes,<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c012'><sup>[1028]</sup></a> who were constantly beheld
grouped in converse, or in action, with these
sublime dwellers of Olympos, were clad in a costume
scarcely less majestic; the former, for example,
in times of prosperity, issued forth from their palaces
in white garments, with loose sleeves reaching
to the elbow, and closed on the upper part of the
arm by a succession of jewelled agraffes,<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c012'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> their
tresses confined in front by a golden sphendone, or
fillet, crusted with gems, while their robes terminated
below in long sweeping trains of purple.<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c012'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> But
when their houses were visited by misfortune, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>milk-white pelisse was exchanged for one quince-coloured
or blue, while the purple train was converted
into black. The costume of the kings,<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c012'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> likewise
varied by circumstances, consisted usually of
an ample robe of purple, or scarlet, or dark green,
descending to the feet, a rich cloak of cloth of
gold, or of some delicate colour, adorned with gold
embroidery, and a lofty mitre on the head.<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c012'><sup>[1032]</sup></a> When
any of these characters, as Tydeus or Meleager, was
engaged in hunting or war, he wore the scarlet or
purple mantle called Ephaptis,<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c012'><sup>[1033]</sup></a> which in action was
wrapped about the left arm. Athenæus, in describing
the horsemen of Antiochos, observes, that these
Ephaptides<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c012'><sup>[1034]</sup></a> were embroidered with gold and adorned
with the figures of animals. Bacchanals and soothsayers,
like Teiresias, generally appeared upon the
stage in an extraordinary garment, denominated
Agrenon,<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c012'><sup>[1035]</sup></a> formed of a reticular fabric of wool of
various colours. Dionysos himself,<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c012'><sup>[1036]</sup></a> in whose honour
the theatre with all its shows was created,
descended from Olympos in a saffron-coloured robe
compressed below the bosom by a broad flowered
belt, and bearing a thyrsus in his hand.<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c012'><sup>[1037]</sup></a> This girdle,
in the case of other gods, or heroes, was sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>replaced by one of gold.<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c012'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> Persons overtaken by
calamity, especially exiles, wore garments dirty-white,
or sad-coloured, or black, or quince-coloured,
or bluish. The costume of Philoctetes, Telephos,
Œneus, Phœnix, Bellerophontes, was ragged. The
Seileni appeared in a shaggy Chiton, and the other
personages of the Satyric drama in the skins of
fawns, or goats, or sheep, or pards, and, sometimes,
in the Theraion or Dionysiac garment, and a flowered
cloak and a scarlet Himation. Old men were distinguished
by the Exomis,<a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c012'><sup>[1039]</sup></a> a white Chiton of mean
appearance, having no seam or arm-hole on the
left side—young men by the Campulè,<a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c012'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> a scarlet or
deep purple Himation,—the parasites by bearing
the Stlengis and flask (as country people by the
Lagobalon) and by black or sad-coloured robes, except
in the play of the Sicyonians, where a person
of this class, being about to be married, sported a
white garment,—the cook by an Himation double
and unfulled,—priestesses by white robes,—comic
old women by such as were quince-coloured or dusky,
like a cloudy morning sky in autumn,—the mothers
of the hetairæ wore a purple fillet about the head,—the
dresses of young women were white and delicate,—of
heiresses the same with fringes. Pornoboski
wore garments of various colours, with flowered
cloaks, and carried a straight wand, called ἀρéσκος.<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c012'><sup>[1041]</sup></a>
There were, likewise, female characters which wore
the Parapechu and the Symmetria, a chiton reaching
to the feet, with a border of marine purple.</p>

<p class='c001'>We now come to the masks,<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c012'><sup>[1042]</sup></a> a subject upon which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>much has been written, though very little has been
explained. The primary difficulty connected with
them is, to determine whether they were so constructed
as to resemble a speaking-trumpet,<a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c012'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> which,
by narrowing the stream, and compressing, as it were,
the particles of the voice, cast it forth condensed
and corroborated upon the theatre,<a id='r1044' /><a href='#f1044' class='c012'><sup>[1044]</sup></a> which it was thus
enabled to penetrate and fill, even to its utmost
extremities. My own opinion, after bestowing much
attention upon the subject, is, that the mask was in
reality so constructed as to communicate additional
force and intensity to the voice; but whether by
roofing or encircling the artificial mouth by metallic
plates, or thin laminæ of the stone called Chalcophonos,<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c012'><sup>[1045]</sup></a>
it is now scarcely possible to determine.
Be this, however, as it may, there existed in some
theatres other contrivances for conveying and augmenting
the volume of the actor’s voice; these were
the Echeia,<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c012'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> vases generally of metal, finely toned,
and arranged according to the musical scale, in a
succession of domed cells,<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c012'><sup>[1047]</sup></a> running in diverging lines
up the hollow face of the theatre. They rested with
one edge upon a smooth and polished pavement, the
mouth outward, and the external edge reposing on the
summit of a small, blunt obelisk,<a id='r1048' /><a href='#f1048' class='c012'><sup>[1048]</sup></a> while a low opening
in each cell enabled the resonances, or echoes,
thus created, to issue forth, and fill the air with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>sound,<a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c012'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> which, however the fact may be accounted
for, produced no isolated reverberations, no confusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The materials wherewith the masks were constructed
varied, no doubt, considerably in different ages;<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c012'><sup>[1050]</sup></a>
but that they were ever manufactured of bronze or
copper is scarcely credible, if we reflect upon the
weight of so voluminous an apparatus, covering the
entire head and neck, composed of either of those
metals. Such metallic specimens as have come down
to us are to be regarded simply as model-masks,
or as works of art, designed by the statuary as ornaments.
The intention, at first, of this disguise being
to give additional boldness and self-confidence to the
actor, by concealing from his neighbours the shamefacedness
which a raw performer would sometimes
naturally feel while strutting about in imperial robes,
and pouring forth the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sesquipedalia verba</i></span> of Pelias
and Telephos, they were contented to cover the face
with a piece of linen, having openings for the eyes
and a breathing-place.<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c012'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> To this appears to have
succeeded a mask manufactured from the flexible
bark of certain trees,<a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c012'><sup>[1052]</sup></a> shaped, of course, and coloured
to resemble the human countenance. The next step
was to employ wood, some kinds of which, while
possessing the advantage of extreme lightness, might
be wrought with all the delicacy and fineness of a
statue, while, better than any other material, it would
receive that smooth and polished enamel by which
were represented the texture<a id='r1053' /><a href='#f1053' class='c012'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> and complexion of
the skin. Specimens of masks of this kind have been
found among nations in a very rude state; among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>inhabitants, for example, of Nootka Sound, whose dress,
we are told,<a id='r1054' /><a href='#f1054' class='c012'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> “is accompanied by a mask representing
the head of some animal: it is made of wood,
with the eyes, teeth, &amp;c., and is a work of considerable
ingenuity. Of these masks they have a
great variety, which are applicable to certain circumstances
and occasions. Those, for example,
which represent the head of the otter or any other
marine animals, are used only when they go to
hunt them. In their war expeditions, but at no
other time, they cover the whole of their dress
with large bear-skins.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But while the above improvements were going
on in the national theatre,<a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c012'><sup>[1055]</sup></a> the rustic drama continued
to preserve its original simplicity, the actors
to prevent their being recognised, shading their brows
with thick projecting crowns of leaves, and daubing
their faces<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c012'><sup>[1056]</sup></a> with lees of wine. Thus disguised they
chanted their songs upon the public roads, sitting
in a waggon,<a id='r1057' /><a href='#f1057' class='c012'><sup>[1057]</sup></a> whence the proverb, “he speaks as
from the waggon,” <i>i. e.</i> he is shamelessly abusive,
which was in fact the case with the comic poets.</p>

<p class='c001'>The masks were divided into three kinds, the
Tragic, the Comic, and the Satyric. Those belonging
to Tragedy were again subdivided into numerous
classes, representing every marked variety
of character, and every stage of human life from
childhood to extreme old age. In the highly varied
range of countenances thus brought into play, the
mask-maker enjoyed abundant opportunities of exhibiting
his skill. The hair, of course, was real and
adjusted on the mask like a wig,<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c012'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> differently fashioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>and coloured according to the age, habits,
and complexion of the wearer. In some cases it
was gathered together and piled up on the forehead,<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c012'><sup>[1059]</sup></a>
in a triangular figure,<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c012'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> adding many inches
to the actor’s stature; at other times it was combed
smoothly downwards, from the crown, twisted round
a fillet and disposed like a wreath about the head
as we sometimes find it in the figures of Asclepios
and the philosopher Archytas. Some characters were
represented wholly bald, with a garland of vine-leaves
or ivy wreathed about the brow,<a id='r1061' /><a href='#f1061' class='c012'><sup>[1061]</sup></a> others were
simply bald in front, while a third class exhibited
a bushy fell of hair, something like a lion’s mane.
Young ladies displayed a profusion of pendant curls,
kept in order by the fillet or sphendone, or gathered
up in nets, or twisted about the head in braided
tresses. In representing certain characters the eye-sockets
were left open, so that the actor’s eyes
could be seen moving and flashing within;<a id='r1062' /><a href='#f1062' class='c012'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> but on
other occasions, when the part of a squinter was to
be acted by a performer who did not squint or
vice versa, as in the case of Roscius Gallus, the
mask-maker must have represented the eyes by
glass or some other transparent substance, through
which the actor could see his way. This was necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the case in the part of the poet Thamyris,<a id='r1063' /><a href='#f1063' class='c012'><sup>[1063]</sup></a>
who, like our own Chatterton, had eyes of different
colours, one blue, the other black, which, as Aristotle
informs us, was common among the horses of
Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>The time of acting, as is well-known, was during
the Dionysiac and Lenæan festivals, in the
spring and autumn.<a id='r1064' /><a href='#f1064' class='c012'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> The theatres being national establishments,
in the proper sense of the word, were
therefore open, free of expense, to all the citizens,
who were not called together as with us by playbills,<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c012'><sup>[1065]</sup></a>
but for the most part knew nothing of what
they were going to see till they were seated in the
theatre, and the herald<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c012'><sup>[1066]</sup></a> commanded the chorus of
such and such a poet to advance. Previously to the
commencement of the performance the theatre was
purified by the sacrifice of a young hog, the blood
of which was sprinkled on the earth.<a id='r1067' /><a href='#f1067' class='c012'><sup>[1067]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c004'>BOOK V. <br /> RURAL LIFE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER I. <br /> THE VILLA AND THE FARMYARD.</h3>

<p class='c011'>If we now, for a moment, quit the city and its
amusements, and observe the tone and character
of Hellenic rural life, we shall find, perhaps, that
there existed in antiquity a still greater contrast
between town and country than in modern times.
From the poetry of Athens, rife with sylvan imagery,
we, no less than from its history, discover
how deeply they loved the sunshine and calm and
quiet of their fields. The rustic population confined
to the city during the Peleponnesian war almost
perished of nostalgia within sight of their village
homes. Half the metaphors in their language are of
country growth. The bee murmurs, the partridge
whirrs, the lark, the nightingale, the thrush, pour
their music through the channels of verse and
prose. The odours of ripe fruit, of new wine “purple
and gushing,” the fresh invigorating morning
breeze from harvest fields, from clover meadows
dotted with kine, the scent of milk-pails, of honey,
and the honey-comb, still breathe sweetly over the
Attic page, and prove how smitten with home delights
the Athenian people were,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With plesaunce of the breathing fields yfed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This their manly and healthful taste, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>constantly, in time of war, exposed them to the
malice of their enemies. For the valleys and
grassy uplands of Attica, being thickly covered
with villas and farmhouses,<a id='r1068' /><a href='#f1068' class='c012'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> the first act of an invading
army was to lay all those beautiful homesteads
in ashes. Thus the Persians, in their two
invasions, destroyed the whole with fire and sword.
But the gentlemen, immediately on their return,
rebuilt their dwellings<a id='r1069' /><a href='#f1069' class='c012'><sup>[1069]</sup></a> with greater taste and magnificence,
so that, before the breaking out of the Peloponnesian
war, it is probable that, as a scene of
unambitious affluence, taste, high cultivation, and
rustic contentment, nothing was ever beheld to
compare with Attica. Here and there, throughout
the land, perched on rocks, or shaded by trees,
were small rustic chapels dedicated to the nymphs,
or rural gods.<a id='r1070' /><a href='#f1070' class='c012'><sup>[1070]</sup></a> On the mountains, and in solitary
glens, and wherever springs gushed from the cliffs,
caverns were scooped out by the hands of the leisurely
shepherds,<a id='r1071' /><a href='#f1071' class='c012'><sup>[1071]</sup></a> and consecrated by association
with mythology. Fountains, also, and water-courses,
altars, statues,<a id='r1072' /><a href='#f1072' class='c012'><sup>[1072]</sup></a> and sacred groves,<a id='r1073' /><a href='#f1073' class='c012'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> protected at once
by religion and the laws,<a id='r1074' /><a href='#f1074' class='c012'><sup>[1074]</sup></a> imprinted on the landscape
features of poetry and elegance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another cause which, in the eyes of the Athenians,
imparted sanctity to their lands, was the practice
of burying in them their dead. The spot selected
for this sacred purpose seems usually to have
been the orchard, where, amid fig-trees and trailing
vines,<a id='r1075' /><a href='#f1075' class='c012'><sup>[1075]</sup></a> often near the boundaries of the estate, might
be seen the ancient and venerable monuments of
the dead. All Attica, therefore, in their eyes, appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>holy as a sepulchre; and, as every one guarded
his own ancestral ashes, to sell a farm cost a man’s
feelings more than in countries where people inter
those they love in public cemeteries; and this circumstance
with many would operate like a law of
entail.<a id='r1076' /><a href='#f1076' class='c012'><sup>[1076]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But it is easy thus to present to the imagination
a general picture of the country. What we want
is to thrust aside the impediments, to dissipate the
obscurity of two thousand years, and lift the latch
of a Greek farmhouse, such as it existed in the days
of Pericles.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place it was common in Attica to
erect country-houses in the midst of a grove of silver
firs,<a id='r1077' /><a href='#f1077' class='c012'><sup>[1077]</sup></a> which in winter protect from cold, and in
summer attract the breezes that imitate in their
branches the sound of trickling runnels, or the distant
murmur of the sea. Towards the centre of the
grove, with a spacious court in front and a garden
behind, stood the house,<a id='r1078' /><a href='#f1078' class='c012'><sup>[1078]</sup></a> sometimes with flat, sometimes
with pointed roof, ornamented with a picturesque
porch, and surrounded with verandahs or
colonnades. Occasionally opulent persons had on the
south front of their houses large citron trees,<a id='r1079' /><a href='#f1079' class='c012'><sup>[1079]</sup></a> growing
in pots, on either side the door, where they
were well watered and carefully covered during winter.<a id='r1080' /><a href='#f1080' class='c012'><sup>[1080]</sup></a>
In the plainer class of dwellings, numerous
outhouses, as stables, sheds for cattle,<a id='r1081' /><a href='#f1081' class='c012'><sup>[1081]</sup></a> henroosts,
pigstyes, &amp;c., extended round the court, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>back-front, generally in the East the principal, opened
upon the garden or orchard.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much pains was usually taken in selecting the site
of a farmhouse,<a id='r1082' /><a href='#f1082' class='c012'><sup>[1082]</sup></a> though opinions of course varied
according to the peculiar range of experience on
which they were based. In general such positions
were considered most favourable as neighboured the
sea, or occupied the summits or the slopes of mountains,<a id='r1083' /><a href='#f1083' class='c012'><sup>[1083]</sup></a>
more especially if looking towards the north.<a id='r1084' /><a href='#f1084' class='c012'><sup>[1084]</sup></a>
The vicinity of swamps and marshes, and as much
as possible of rivers, was avoided, together with
coombs, or hollow valleys, and declivities facing the
south or the setting sun. If necessitated by the
nature of the ground to build near the banks of a
stream, the front of the dwelling was carefully turned
away from it, inasmuch as its waters communicated
an additional rigour to the winds in winter, and in
summer filled the atmosphere with unwholesome
vapours. The favourite exposure was towards the
east whence the most salubrious breezes were supposed
to blow, while the cheerful beams of the sun,
as soon as they streamed above the horizon, dissipated
the dank fogs and murkiness of the air. Notwithstanding
the warmth of the climate, moreover,
they loved such situations as were all day long illuminated
by the sun, whilst every care was taken
to fence out the sirocco, a moist and pestilential
wind, blowing across the Mediterranean from the
deserts of Africa. In Italy, nevertheless, the farmer
often selected for the site of his mansion the
southern roots of mountains, further defended from
Alpine blasts by a sweep of lofty woods.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to the fashion prevailing in antiquity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>farmhouses were built high, large, and roomy, though
Cato<a id='r1085' /><a href='#f1085' class='c012'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> shrewdly advises, that their magnitude should
bear some relation to that of the domain, lest the
villa should have to seek for the farm, or the farm
for the villa.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much, however, would depend upon the taste of
the individual; but in a plain farmhouse more attention
appears to have been paid to substantial comfort,
and something like rough John-Bullism, than to
that cold finical elegance which certain persons are
fond of associating with whatever is classical. An
Attic farmer of the true old republican school was
anything but a fine gentleman. He scorned none
of the occupations or productions by which he lived.
On entering his dwelling you found no small difficulty
in steering between bags of corn,<a id='r1086' /><a href='#f1086' class='c012'><sup>[1086]</sup></a> piles of
cheeses, hurdles of dried figs<a id='r1087' /><a href='#f1087' class='c012'><sup>[1087]</sup></a> or raisins, while the
racks groaned with hams<a id='r1088' /><a href='#f1088' class='c012'><sup>[1088]</sup></a> and bacon flitches. If
they resembled their descendants,<a id='r1089' /><a href='#f1089' class='c012'><sup>[1089]</sup></a> too, even their
bedchambers were invaded by some species of provisions,
for there in the present day you often behold
long strings of melons suspended like festoons
from the rafters. In one corner of the ground-floor
stood a corbel filled with olive-dregs, recently pressed,
in another a wool-sack or a pile of dressed skins.<a id='r1090' /><a href='#f1090' class='c012'><sup>[1090]</sup></a>
Yonder in the room looking into the garden, with
the honey-suckle twining about the open lattice,
were madam’s loom and spinning-wheel, and carding
apparatus, and work-baskets; and there with the
lark<a id='r1091' /><a href='#f1091' class='c012'><sup>[1091]</sup></a> might you see her, serene and happy, suckling
her young democrat, and rocking the cradle of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>second with her foot, thriftily giving directions the
while to Thratta, Xanthia or “the neat-handed”
Phillis.<a id='r1092' /><a href='#f1092' class='c012'><sup>[1092]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The kitchen must sometimes have been in fine
disorder; geese and ducks waddling across the floor,
picking up the spilled grain, or snatching away the
piece of bread and honey which my young master
had just put down on the stool to play at a game
of romps with Thratta. Up in the dusky corner
there, behind a huge armchair or settle, you may
discern a very suspicious looking enclosure, from
which, at intervals, issues a suppressed grunt; it
is the pigsty.<a id='r1093' /><a href='#f1093' class='c012'><sup>[1093]</sup></a> But be not offended; the practice
is classical; and pigs, in my apprehension, are as
pleasant company as geese and many other animals.
Now, that geese were fed even about palaces, we
have the testimony of Homer, whose Penelope, <a id='corr274.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_274.18'><ins class='correction' title='the'>the</ins></a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>beau idéal</i></span> of a good housewife, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Full twenty geese have we at home, that feed</div>
      <div class='line'>On wheat in water steeped.”<a id='r1094' /><a href='#f1094' class='c012'><sup>[1094]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But the whole economy of geese-feeding<a id='r1095' /><a href='#f1095' class='c012'><sup>[1095]</sup></a> has
been transmitted to us; in the first place, the birds
usually preferred were those most remarkable for
their size and whiteness.<a id='r1096' /><a href='#f1096' class='c012'><sup>[1096]</sup></a> The ancients esteemed
the variegated, or spotted, as of inferior value. The
same rule applied to fowls. The chenoboscion,<a id='r1097' /><a href='#f1097' class='c012'><sup>[1097]</sup></a> or
enclosure in which the geese were kept, was commonly
situated near ponds or freshes,<a id='r1098' /><a href='#f1098' class='c012'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> abounding
with rich grass and aquatic plants. Geese, it was
observed, are not nice in the article of food, but
devour eagerly nearly all kinds of plants, though
the chick-pea, and the couch-grass, the laurel and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the laurel-rose,<a id='r1099' /><a href='#f1099' class='c012'><sup>[1099]</sup></a> were by the ancients supposed to
be hurtful to them. Of their eggs some were
hatched by hens, but such as were designed to be
sitten on by the goose herself, (who, during the
period of incubation<a id='r1100' /><a href='#f1100' class='c012'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> was fed on barley steeped
in water,) were marked by writing or otherwise,
to distinguish them from the eggs of their neighbours,
which it was thought she would not be at
the pains to hatch. For the first ten days after
they had broken the shell the young goslings were
kept within-doors, where they were fed on wheat
steeped in water, <em>polenta</em> a preparation of barley-meal
dried at the fire, and chopped cresses. This
period over, they were driven out to feed and afterwards
to water; they who tended them taking great
care that they should not be stung by nettles, or
pricked by thorns, or swallow the hair<a id='r1101' /><a href='#f1101' class='c012'><sup>[1101]</sup></a> of pigs or
kids, which they imagined to be fatal to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>When full-grown geese were intended to be fattened,
the custom was, to confine them in dark and
extremely warm cells.<a id='r1102' /><a href='#f1102' class='c012'><sup>[1102]</sup></a> Their food was scientifically
varied and regulated, proceeding from less to more
nutritious, until they were judged fit for the table.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>At first their diet consisted of a preparation composed
of two parts <em>polenta</em>, and four parts bran boiled
in water. Of this they were permitted to eat as
much as they pleased three times a day, and once
again at midnight, while water was furnished them
in abundance. When they had continued on this
regimen for some time, they were indulged with a
more luxurious table,—nothing less than the most
exquisite dried figs, which, being chopped small, and
dissolved in water, were served up as a sort of jelly
for twenty days, after which the pampered animal
itself was ready for the spit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Occasionally that delicate and humane device, for
the practice of which Germany has, in modern times,
obtained so enviable a celebrity, of enlarging preternaturally
the dimensions of the liver, was resorted
to by the ancients,<a id='r1103' /><a href='#f1103' class='c012'><sup>[1103]</sup></a> whose mode of proceeding was
as follows: during five-and-twenty days, being cooped
up as before in a place of high temperature, the
geese were fed with wheat and barley steeped in
water, the former of which fattened, while the latter
rendered their flesh delicately white. For the next
five days certain cakes or balls, denominated collyria,<a id='r1104' /><a href='#f1104' class='c012'><sup>[1104]</sup></a>
the composition of which is not exactly known,
were given them at the rate of seven per day, after
which the number was gradually augmented to fifteen,
which constituted their whole allowance for other
twenty days. To this succeeded the most extraordinary
dish of all, consisting of bolusses of leavened
dough, steeped in a warm decoction of mallows, by
which they were puffed up for four days. Their
drink, meanwhile, was still more delicious than their
food, being nothing less than hydromel,<a id='r1105' /><a href='#f1105' class='c012'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> or water
mingled with honey. During the last six days dried
figs, chopped fine, were added to their leaven, and
the process being thus brought to a conclusion, the
gourmands for whom they were intended, feasted on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the tenderest geese and the largest livers in the
world. It should be added, however, that before
being cooked the liver was thrown into a basin of
warm water, which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>artistes</i></span> several times changed.
Geese, adds the ingenious gastronomer to whom we
are indebted for these details, are, both for flesh and
liver, much inferior to ganders. The Greeks did
not, however, like the Romans and the moderns,
select young geese for this species of culinary apotheosis,
but birds of a mature age and of the largest
size, from two to four years old, which only proves
the superior strength and keenness of their teeth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ducks were kept in ponds, carefully enclosed, and,
perhaps, covered over that they might not fly away.
In the centre were certain green islets,<a id='r1106' /><a href='#f1106' class='c012'><sup>[1106]</sup></a> planted with
couch-grass, which the ancients considered as beneficial
to ducks as it was hurtful to geese. Their usual
food, which was cast in the water encircling the
islets, consisted of wheat, millet, barley, sometimes
mixed with grape-stones and grape-skins. Occasionally
they were indulged with locusts, prawns, shrimps,<a id='r1107' /><a href='#f1107' class='c012'><sup>[1107]</sup></a>
and whatever else aquatic birds habitually feed
on. Persons desirous of possessing tame ducks were
accustomed to beat about the lakes and marshes<a id='r1108' /><a href='#f1108' class='c012'><sup>[1108]</sup></a>
for the nest of the wild bird. Giving the eggs
to a hen to sit on, they obtained a brood of ducklings
perfectly domesticated.<a id='r1109' /><a href='#f1109' class='c012'><sup>[1109]</sup></a> Wild ducks were
sometimes caught by pouring red wine, or the lees
of wine, into the springs whither they came to
drink.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to barn-door fowl, originally introduced
from India and Media into Greece, the
greatest care appears to have been taken to vary
and improve the breeds. For this purpose cocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>and hens were imported<a id='r1110' /><a href='#f1110' class='c012'><sup>[1110]</sup></a> from the shores of the
Adriatic, from Italy, Sicily, Numidia, and Egypt,
while those of Attica were occasionally exported
to other countries. There appears to have been
a prejudice against keeping more than fifty fowls<a id='r1111' /><a href='#f1111' class='c012'><sup>[1111]</sup></a>
about one farmyard, some traces of which may
also be discovered in the practice of the Arabs.<a id='r1112' /><a href='#f1112' class='c012'><sup>[1112]</sup></a>
The fowl-house furnished with roosts,<a id='r1113' /><a href='#f1113' class='c012'><sup>[1113]</sup></a> as with us,
was so contrived and situated as to receive from
the kitchen a tolerable supply of smoke, which was
supposed to be agreeable to these Median strangers.
The food of fowls<a id='r1114' /><a href='#f1114' class='c012'><sup>[1114]</sup></a> being much the same all the
world over, it is unnecessary to observe more than
that the green leaves of the Cytisus were supposed
to render them prolific. To preserve them from
vermin, the juice of rue, by way I suppose of
charm, was sprinkled over their feathers.<a id='r1115' /><a href='#f1115' class='c012'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> The
proportion of male birds was one to six. Hens
were usually put to sit about the vernal equinox,
during the first quarter of the moon, in nests carefully
constructed of boards, and strewed with fresh
clean straw, into which, as a sort of talisman against
thunder, they threw an iron nail, heads of garlic, and
sprigs of laurel.<a id='r1116' /><a href='#f1116' class='c012'><sup>[1116]</sup></a> During the period of incubation,
the eggs which had previously been kept in bran
were turned every day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other inhabitants of the farmyard were peacocks,<a id='r1117' /><a href='#f1117' class='c012'><sup>[1117]</sup></a>
commonly confined in beautiful artificial islands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>provided with elegant sheds; pheasants<a id='r1118' /><a href='#f1118' class='c012'><sup>[1118]</sup></a> from the
shores of the Black Sea;<a id='r1119' /><a href='#f1119' class='c012'><sup>[1119]</sup></a> guinea-fowls from Numidia,<a id='r1120' /><a href='#f1120' class='c012'><sup>[1120]</sup></a>
though according to other authors they were
originally found in Ætolia;<a id='r1121' /><a href='#f1121' class='c012'><sup>[1121]</sup></a> partridges, quails, and
the attagas. Thrushes were bred in warm rooms
with slight perches projecting from the walls, and
laurel boughs or other evergreens fixed in the corners.<a id='r1122' /><a href='#f1122' class='c012'><sup>[1122]</sup></a>
Over the clean floor was strewed their food,
dried figs, which had been steeped in water, and
mixed with flour or barley meal, together with the
berries of the myrtle; the lentiscus, the ivy, the
laurel, and the olive. They were fattened with millet,
panic, and pure water.<a id='r1123' /><a href='#f1123' class='c012'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> Other still smaller birds
were reared, and fattened in like manner. Every
farmhouse had, moreover, its columbary and dove-cotes,<a id='r1124' /><a href='#f1124' class='c012'><sup>[1124]</sup></a>
sometimes so large as to contain five thousand
birds. They usually consisted of spacious buildings,<a id='r1125' /><a href='#f1125' class='c012'><sup>[1125]</sup></a>
roofed over and furnished with windows closed
by lattice work, made so close that neither a lizard
nor a mouse could creep through them. In the
floor were channels and basins of water, in which
these delicate birds<a id='r1126' /><a href='#f1126' class='c012'><sup>[1126]</sup></a> might wash and plume themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>and adjoining was a chamber into which such
as were required for sale, or the table, were enticed.
Even jackdaws were kept about farmyards,
and like common fowls had perches set up for
them.<a id='r1127' /><a href='#f1127' class='c012'><sup>[1127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Much pains was taken by the ancients to improve
the breed of animals.<a id='r1128' /><a href='#f1128' class='c012'><sup>[1128]</sup></a> Polycrates, tyrant of
Samos, introduced into that island the Molossian
and Spartan dogs, goats from Scyros and Naxos,
and sheep from Attica and Miletos.<a id='r1129' /><a href='#f1129' class='c012'><sup>[1129]</sup></a> The fineness
and beauty of Merinos were also known to the ancients,
who purchased from Spain rams for breeding
at a talent each, that is, about two hundred
and forty-one pounds sterling.<a id='r1130' /><a href='#f1130' class='c012'><sup>[1130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Horses were at all times few, and, consequently,
dear in Greece; they were, therefore, seldom employed
in agriculture, but bred and kept chiefly for
the army, for religious pomps and processions, and
for the chariot races at Olympia. Originally, no
doubt, the horse was introduced from Asia, and, up
to a very late period, chargers of great beauty and
spirit, continued to be imported from the shores of
the Black Sea.<a id='r1131' /><a href='#f1131' class='c012'><sup>[1131]</sup></a> Princes, in the Homeric age, appear
to have obtained celebrity for the beauty of
their steeds, as Laomedon, Tros, and Rhesos; and
it was customary for them to possess studs of brood
mares in the rich pasture lands on the sea-shore.
That of Priam, for example, lay at Abydos, on the
Hellespont.<a id='r1132' /><a href='#f1132' class='c012'><sup>[1132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The high estimation in which horses<a id='r1133' /><a href='#f1133' class='c012'><sup>[1133]</sup></a> were held
in remote antiquity, may be gathered from the numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>fables invented respecting them,—as that of
the centaurs in Thessaly, of the winged courser of
Bellerophontes, and the Muses, and of the marvellous
steeds presented by Poseidon to Peleus on his
marriage with Thetis. They were reckoned, likewise,
among the most precious victims offered in
sacrifice to the gods. Thus we find the Trojans
plunging live horses into the whirlpool of the Scamander<a id='r1134' /><a href='#f1134' class='c012'><sup>[1134]</sup></a>
to deprecate the anger of that divinity.
The Romans, likewise, in later times, sacrificed horses
to the ocean;<a id='r1135' /><a href='#f1135' class='c012'><sup>[1135]</sup></a> and, in many parts of Asia, it appears
to have been customary in nearly all ages, to
offer up, as anciently in Laconia,<a id='r1136' /><a href='#f1136' class='c012'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> this magnificent
animal on the altars of the sun.<a id='r1137' /><a href='#f1137' class='c012'><sup>[1137]</sup></a> Thus, among the
Armenians, whose breed, though smaller than that
of the Persians, was far more spirited, this practice
prevailed as it still does in Northern India, and
Xenophon,<a id='r1138' /><a href='#f1138' class='c012'><sup>[1138]</sup></a> a religious man, observes in the Anabasis,
that he gave his steed, worn down with the
fatigues of the march, to be fed and offered up by
the Komarch, with whom he had been for some
days a guest. From Homer’s account of Pandarus
we may infer, that the possessors of fine horses
often submitted to great personal inconvenience
rather than hazard the well-being of their favourites.
For this wealthy prince,<a id='r1139' /><a href='#f1139' class='c012'><sup>[1139]</sup></a> who possessed eleven carriages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and twenty-two steeds, came on foot to the
assistance of Priam, lest they should not find a plentiful
supply of provender at Troy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several countries were famous<a id='r1140' /><a href='#f1140' class='c012'><sup>[1140]</sup></a> for their breed of
horses, as Cyrene, Egypt, Syria, Phrygia, and the
Phasis.<a id='r1141' /><a href='#f1141' class='c012'><sup>[1141]</sup></a> Thessaly, too, particularly the neighbourhood
of Triccæ, abounded in barbs, as did likewise
Bœotia. But one of the most remarkable races
was that produced in Nisæon,<a id='r1142' /><a href='#f1142' class='c012'><sup>[1142]</sup></a> a district of Media,
which seems to have been white, or of a bright
cream colour,<a id='r1143' /><a href='#f1143' class='c012'><sup>[1143]</sup></a> and of extraordinary size and swiftness.
On one of these Masistios<a id='r1144' /><a href='#f1144' class='c012'><sup>[1144]</sup></a> was mounted during
the expedition into Greece. Apollo, in an oracle
is said to have spoken of the beauty of mares,
alluding, perhaps, to those of Elis, which were remarkable
for their lightness and elegance of form;
and Aristotle celebrates a particular mare of Pharsatis,
called Dicæa, which was famous for bringing
colts resembling their sires.<a id='r1145' /><a href='#f1145' class='c012'><sup>[1145]</sup></a> Among the Homeric
chiefs, Achilles and Eumelos boasted the noblest
coursers, as we learn from a picturesque and striking
passage in the Catalogue:<a id='r1146' /><a href='#f1146' class='c012'><sup>[1146]</sup></a> “And now, O Muse,
declare, which of the leaders and their horses were
most illustrious. Excepting those of Achilles, the
finest steeds before Troy were those of Eumelos
from Pheræ, swift as birds, alike in mane, in
age, and so equal in size, that a rule would stand
level on their backs. They were both bred by
Apollo in Pieria, both mares, and they bore with
them the dread of battle. Noblest of all, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>were the coursers of Achilles. But he, in
his lunar-prowed, sea-passing ships remains incensed
against Atreides, the shepherd of his
people; his myrmidons amuse themselves on the
sea-shore with pitching the quoit, launching the
javelin, and drawing the bow; their horses, standing
beside the chariots, feed upon lotus, trefoil and
marsh parsley; and the chariots themselves, well
covered with hangings, are drawn up in the tents
of the chiefs, while the soldiers, sighing for the
leading of their impetuous general, stroll carelessly
through the camp without joining in the war.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The food of the Homeric horses,<a id='r1147' /><a href='#f1147' class='c012'><sup>[1147]</sup></a> was little inferior
to that of their masters, since, besides the
natural delicacies of the meadows, they were indulged
with sifted barley and the finest wheat.<a id='r1148' /><a href='#f1148' class='c012'><sup>[1148]</sup></a>
The halter with which, while feeding, they were tied
to the manger seems usually to have been of leather.
Aristotle,<a id='r1149' /><a href='#f1149' class='c012'><sup>[1149]</sup></a> remarks, that horses are fattened less by
their food than by what they drink, and that, like
the camel,<a id='r1150' /><a href='#f1150' class='c012'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> they delight in muddy water, on which

<p class='c001'>The Greek conception of equine beauty<a id='r1151' /><a href='#f1151' class='c012'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> differed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>but little from our own, since they chiefly loved
horses of those colours which are still the objects of
admiration: as snow-white, with black eyes like those
of Rhesos, which Plato thought the most beautiful;
cream-coloured, light bay, chestnut, and smoky grey.
They judged of the breeding of a horse by the shortness
of its coat and the dusky prominence of its
veins. As a fine large mane greatly augments the
magnificent appearance of this animal, they were
careful after washing to comb and oil it<a id='r1152' /><a href='#f1152' class='c012'><sup>[1152]</sup></a> while they
gathered up the forelock in a band of gilded leather.<a id='r1153' /><a href='#f1153' class='c012'><sup>[1153]</sup></a>
The floors of their stables were commonly pitched
with round pebbles bound tight together by curbs
of iron.<a id='r1154' /><a href='#f1154' class='c012'><sup>[1154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Horses were usually broken<a id='r1155' /><a href='#f1155' class='c012'><sup>[1155]</sup></a> by professed grooms,
who entered into a written agreement with the
owners implicitly to follow their directions.<a id='r1156' /><a href='#f1156' class='c012'><sup>[1156]</sup></a> The
process was sufficiently simple. They began with
the year-and-a-half colts,<a id='r1157' /><a href='#f1157' class='c012'><sup>[1157]</sup></a> on which they put a halter
when feeding, while a bridle was hung up close to
the manger, that they might be accustomed to the
touch of it, and not take fright at the jingling of
the bit.<a id='r1158' /><a href='#f1158' class='c012'><sup>[1158]</sup></a> The next step was to lead them into the
midst of noisy and tumultuous crowds in order to
discover whether or not they were bold enough to
be employed in war.<a id='r1159' /><a href='#f1159' class='c012'><sup>[1159]</sup></a> The operation was not completely
finished till they were three years old. When,
on the course or elsewhere, horses had been well
sweated,<a id='r1160' /><a href='#f1160' class='c012'><sup>[1160]</sup></a> they were led into a place set apart for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the purpose, and, in order to dry themselves, made
to roll in the sand. It was customary for owners
to mark their horses with the Koppa,<a id='r1161' /><a href='#f1161' class='c012'><sup>[1161]</sup></a> or other letter
of the alphabet, whence they were sometimes
called Koppatias, Samphoras, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mule and the ass were much employed in
rural labours, the former both at the cart and the
plough, the latter in drawing small tumbrils, and in
bearing wood<a id='r1162' /><a href='#f1162' class='c012'><sup>[1162]</sup></a> or other produce of the farm to the
city.<a id='r1163' /><a href='#f1163' class='c012'><sup>[1163]</sup></a> The wild ass<a id='r1164' /><a href='#f1164' class='c012'><sup>[1164]</sup></a> was sometimes resorted to
for improving the breed of mules, which, in the
Homeric age, were found in a state of nature among
the mountains of Paphlagonia.<a id='r1165' /><a href='#f1165' class='c012'><sup>[1165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But their cares extended even to swine, which, if
King Ptolemy may be credited, were sometimes
distinguished in Greece for their great size and
beauty. He, in fact, observes in his Memoirs, that
in the city of Assos he saw a milk-white hog two
cubits and a half in length, and of equal height;
and adds, that King Eumenes had given four thousand
drachmæ, or nearly two hundred pounds sterling,
for a boar of this enormous size, to improve the
breed of pigs in his country.<a id='r1166' /><a href='#f1166' class='c012'><sup>[1166]</sup></a> So that we perceive
those great generals, whom posterity usually contemplates
only in the cabinet or in the battle-field, were,
at the same time, in their domestic policy, the rivals
of the Earls Spencer and Leicester. Superstition,
among the Cretans, prevented the improvement of
bacon; for as a sow was said to have suckled the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>infant Jupiter, and defended his helpless infancy, they,
in gratitude,<a id='r1167' /><a href='#f1167' class='c012'><sup>[1167]</sup></a> abstained from hog’s flesh.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all farms the care of cattle necessarily formed
a principal employment. The oxen<a id='r1168' /><a href='#f1168' class='c012'><sup>[1168]</sup></a> were used in
ploughing, treading out the corn, drawing manure to
the fields, and bringing home the produce of the
harvest. To prevent their being overcome by fatigue
while engaged in their labours, the husbandmen of
Greece had recourse to certain expedients, one of
which was, to smear their hoofs with a composition
of oil and terebinth, or wax, or warm pitch:<a id='r1169' /><a href='#f1169' class='c012'><sup>[1169]</sup></a> while,
to protect them from flies, their coats were anointed
with their own saliva, or with a decoction of bruised
laurel berries and oil.<a id='r1170' /><a href='#f1170' class='c012'><sup>[1170]</sup></a> Their milch cows, in the
selection of which much judgment was displayed,<a id='r1171' /><a href='#f1171' class='c012'><sup>[1171]</sup></a>
were commonly fed on cytisus and clover; and, still
further to increase their milk, bunches of the herb
dittany were sometimes tied about their flanks. The
usual milking-times<a id='r1172' /><a href='#f1172' class='c012'><sup>[1172]</sup></a> were, in the morning immediately
after the breaking-up of the dawn, and in
the evening about the close of twilight; though,
occasionally, both cows, sheep, and goats were milked
several times during the day. In weaning calves
they made use of a species of muzzle,<a id='r1173' /><a href='#f1173' class='c012'><sup>[1173]</sup></a> as the Arabs
do in the case of young camels. Their pails, like
our own, were of wood,<a id='r1174' /><a href='#f1174' class='c012'><sup>[1174]</sup></a> but somewhat differently
shaped, being narrow above, and spreading towards
the bottom. When conveyed into the dairy the milk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>was poured into pans,<a id='r1175' /><a href='#f1175' class='c012'><sup>[1175]</sup></a> on the form of which I have
hitherto found no information.<a id='r1176' /><a href='#f1176' class='c012'><sup>[1176]</sup></a> That they skimmed
their milk is evident (whatever they may have done
with the cream), from the mention of that thin
pellicle which is found on it only when skimmed,
whether scalded or not. “Here, drink this!” said
Glycera to Menander, when he had returned one
day in exceeding ill-humour from the theatre. “I
don’t like the wrinkled skin,” replied the poet to
the lady, whose beauty, it must be remembered,
was at this time on the wane. “Blow it off,” replied
she, immediately comprehending his meaning, “and
take what is beneath.”<a id='r1177' /><a href='#f1177' class='c012'><sup>[1177]</sup></a> Milk, in those warm latitudes,
grows sour more rapidly than with us; but
the ancients observed that it would keep three days
when it had been scalded, and stirred until cold with
a reed or ferula.<a id='r1178' /><a href='#f1178' class='c012'><sup>[1178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks of classical times appear to have made
no use of butter,<a id='r1179' /><a href='#f1179' class='c012'><sup>[1179]</sup></a> though so early as the age of Hippocrates
they were well enough acquainted with its
existence and properties.<a id='r1180' /><a href='#f1180' class='c012'><sup>[1180]</sup></a> Even in the present day
butter is much less used in Greece than in most
European countries, its place being supplied by fine
olive oil. For cheese, however, they seem to have
entertained a partiality, though it is probable that
the best they could manufacture would have lost
very considerably in comparison with good Stilton
or Cheshire, not to mention Parmasan. It was a
favourite food, however, among soldiers in Attica,
who during war used to supply themselves both with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>cheese and meal.<a id='r1181' /><a href='#f1181' class='c012'><sup>[1181]</sup></a> Their cheese-lope or rennet in
most cases resembled our own, consisting of the
liquid substance found in the ruen of new-born
animals, as calves, kids, or hares, which was considered
superior to lamb’s rennet.<a id='r1182' /><a href='#f1182' class='c012'><sup>[1182]</sup></a> Occasionally they
employed for the same purpose burnt salt or vinegar,
fowl’s crop or pepper, the flowers of bastard
saffron, or the threads which grow on the head of
the artichoke. For these again, was sometimes substituted
the juice of the fig-tree;<a id='r1183' /><a href='#f1183' class='c012'><sup>[1183]</sup></a> or a branch freshly
cut<a id='r1184' /><a href='#f1184' class='c012'><sup>[1184]</sup></a> was used in stirring the milk while warming
on the fire. This cheese would seem, for the most
part, to have been eaten while fresh and soft,<a id='r1185' /><a href='#f1185' class='c012'><sup>[1185]</sup></a> like
that of Neufchatel, though they were acquainted
with various means of preserving it for a considerable
space of time. Acidulated curds were kept
soft by being wrapped in the leaves of the terebinth
tree, or plunged in oil, or sprinkled with salt.
When desirous of preserving their cheese for any
length of time, they washed it in pure water, and,
after drying it in the sun, laid it upon earthen jars
with thyme and summer savory. Some other kinds
were kept in a sort of pickle, composed of sweet
vinegar or oxymel or sea-water, which was poured
into the jars until it entirely penetrated and covered
the whole mass. When they wished to communicate
a peculiar whiteness to the cheese, they laid
it up in brine. Dry cheese was rendered more
solid and sharp-tasted by being placed within reach
of the smoke. If from age it were hard or bitter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>it was thrown into a preparation of barley-meal,
then soaked in water, and what rose to the top
was skimmed off.<a id='r1186' /><a href='#f1186' class='c012'><sup>[1186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>That the milk-women in Greece understood all the
arts of their profession may be gathered from the
instructions which have been left us on the best methods
of detecting the presence of water in milk. If
you dip a sharp rush into milk, says Berytios, and
it run off easily, there is water in it. And again,
if you pour a few drops upon your thumb-nail, the
pure milk will maintain its position, while the adulterated
will immediately glide away!<a id='r1187' /><a href='#f1187' class='c012'><sup>[1187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Their mode of fattening cattle<a id='r1188' /><a href='#f1188' class='c012'><sup>[1188]</sup></a> was as follows:
first they fed them on cabbage chopped small and
steeped in vinegar, to which succeeded chaff and gurgions
during five days. This diet was then exchanged
for barley, of which for nearly a week they were
allowed four cotylæ a-day, the quantity being then
gradually augmented for six other days. As of necessity
the hinds were stirring early, the cattle began
even in winter to be fed at cock-crowing; a second
quantity of food was given them about dawn, when
they were watered, and their remaining allowance
towards evening. In summer their first meal commenced
at day-break, the second at mid-day, and
the third about sunset. They were at this time of
the year suffered to drink at noon and night of
water rendered somewhat tepid; in winter it was
considerably warmer.</p>

<p class='c001'>About Mossynos, in Thrace, cattle were sometimes
fed upon fish, which was likewise given to horses,
and even to sheep. Herodotus, who mentions a
similar fact, calls food of this description χόρτος,
“fodder,”<a id='r1189' /><a href='#f1189' class='c012'><sup>[1189]</sup></a> though hay or dried straw was, doubtless,
its original meaning. The provender of cattle
in the district about Ænia appears to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>so wholesome, that the herds which fed upon it
were never afflicted by the mange.<a id='r1190' /><a href='#f1190' class='c012'><sup>[1190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the animals domesticated and rendered
useful by the Greeks we must, doubtless, reckon
bees,<a id='r1191' /><a href='#f1191' class='c012'><sup>[1191]</sup></a> which, in the heroic ages, had not yet been
confined in hives. For, whenever Homer describes
them, it is either where they are streaming forth
from a rock,<a id='r1192' /><a href='#f1192' class='c012'><sup>[1192]</sup></a> or settling in bands and clusters on
the spring flowers. So, likewise, in Virgil, they</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>Hunt the golden dew;</div>

      <div class='line'>And creep within their bells to suck the balmy seed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In that Bœotian old savage, Hesiod,<a id='r1193' /><a href='#f1193' class='c012'><sup>[1193]</sup></a> however, we
undoubtedly find mention of the hive where he is
uncourteously comparing women to drones—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As when within their well-roofed hives the bees</div>
      <div class='line'>Maintain the mischief-working drones at ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their task pursuing till the golden sun</div>
      <div class='line'>Down to the western wave his course hath run,</div>
      <div class='line'>Filling their shining combs, while snug within</div>
      <div class='line'>Their fragrant cells, the drones, with idle din,</div>
      <div class='line'>As princes revel o’er their unpaid bowls,</div>
      <div class='line'>On others’ labours cheer their worthless souls.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c014'>As the honey of Attica constantly, in antiquity,
enjoyed the reputation of being the finest in the
world,<a id='r1194' /><a href='#f1194' class='c012'><sup>[1194]</sup></a> the management of bees naturally formed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that country an important branch of rural economy.
The natural history, moreover, of the bee was studied
with singlar enthusiam by the Greeks in general.
Aristomachos of Soli, devoted to it fifty-eight
years, and Philiscos, the Thasian, who passed
his life among bees in a desert, obtained on that
account the name of the Wild Man. Both wrote
on the subject.<a id='r1195' /><a href='#f1195' class='c012'><sup>[1195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This branch of rural economy was carried to very
great perfection in Attica. The vocabulary<a id='r1196' /><a href='#f1196' class='c012'><sup>[1196]</sup></a> connected
with it was extensive, as every separate
operation had its technical term, by the study of
which, chiefly, an insight into their practice is obtained.
Thus, from certain expressions employed
by Aristotle<a id='r1197' /><a href='#f1197' class='c012'><sup>[1197]</sup></a> and Pollux, it seems clear that bee-managers,
whom we may occasionally call melitturgi,
constituted a separate division among the
industrious classes; and these, instructed by constant
experience, probably anticipated most of the improvements
imagined in modern times. For example,
instead of destroying the valuable and industrious
little insects for the purpose of obtaining possession
of their spoils, they in some cases compelled them
by smoke to retire temporarily from the hive, whence
their treasures were to be taken; and in the mining
districts about Laureion they understood the art,
concerning which, however, no particulars are known,
of procuring the virgin honey pure and unsmoked.<a id='r1198' /><a href='#f1198' class='c012'><sup>[1198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The grounds of a melitturgos or bee-keeper were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>chosen and laid out with peculiar care.<a id='r1199' /><a href='#f1199' class='c012'><sup>[1199]</sup></a> In a sheltered
spot, generally on the thymy slope of a hill,
the hives were arranged in the midst of flowers and
odoriferous shrubs. And if the necessary kinds had
not by nature been scattered there, they were planted
by the gardener. Experience soon taught them what
blossoms and flowers yielded the best honey,<a id='r1200' /><a href='#f1200' class='c012'><sup>[1200]</sup></a> and
were most agreeable to the bees. These, in Attica,
were supposed to be the wild pear-tree, the bean,
clover, a pale-coloured vetch, the syria, myrtle, wild
poppy, wild thyme, and the almond-tree.<a id='r1201' /><a href='#f1201' class='c012'><sup>[1201]</sup></a> To which
may be added the rose, balm gentle, the galingale
or odoriferous rush, basil royal, and above all the
cytisus,<a id='r1202' /><a href='#f1202' class='c012'><sup>[1202]</sup></a> which begins to flower about the vernal
equinox, and continues in bloom to the end of September.<a id='r1203' /><a href='#f1203' class='c012'><sup>[1203]</sup></a>
Of all the plants, however, affected by the
bee, none is so grateful to it as the thyme, which
so extensively abounds in Attica and Messenia<a id='r1204' /><a href='#f1204' class='c012'><sup>[1204]</sup></a> as
to perfume the whole atmosphere. In Sicily too,
all the slopes and crests of its beautiful hills, from
Palermo to Syracuse, are invested with a mantle of
thyme,<a id='r1205' /><a href='#f1205' class='c012'><sup>[1205]</sup></a> and other odoriferous shrubs, which, according
to Varro, gives the superior flavour to the Sicilian
honey. Box-wood abounded on mount Cytoros,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>in Galatia, and in the island of Corsica, on which
account the honey of the latter country was bitter.<a id='r1206' /><a href='#f1206' class='c012'><sup>[1206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In selecting a spot for hives, the ancients observed
a rule which I do not recollect to have been mentioned
by modern bee-keepers, and that was to avoid
the neighbourhood of an echo,<a id='r1207' /><a href='#f1207' class='c012'><sup>[1207]</sup></a> which by repeating
their own buzzing and murmuring suggested the idea
perhaps of invisible rivals. Place them not, says
Virgil,<a id='r1208' /><a href='#f1208' class='c012'><sup>[1208]</sup></a></p>

      <div class='line'>Near hollow rocks that render back the sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>And doubled images of voice rebound.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Care was taken to conduct near the hives small
runnels of the purest water, not exceeding two or
three inches in depth with shells or pebbles rising
dry above the surface, whereon the bees might alight
to drink.<a id='r1209' /><a href='#f1209' class='c012'><sup>[1209]</sup></a> When of necessity the apiary was situated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>on the margin of lakes or larger streams other contrivances
were had recourse to for the convenience
of the airy labourers.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Their hives were of various kinds and shapes.
Some, like the modern Circassians, they made with
fine wicker-work, of a round form and carefully plastered
on the inside with clay.<a id='r1210' /><a href='#f1210' class='c012'><sup>[1210]</sup></a> Other hives were
constructed of bark, especially that of the cork-tree,
others of fig, oxya, beech, and pine-wood,<a id='r1211' /><a href='#f1211' class='c012'><sup>[1211]</sup></a> others, as
now in Spain, of the trunk of a hollow tree, others
of earthenware, as is the practice in Russia; and
others again of plaited cane of a square shape, three
feet in length and about one in breadth, but so contrived
that, should the honey materials prove scanty,
they might be contracted, lest the bees should lose
courage if surrounded by a large empty space. The
wicker-hives were occasionally plastered both inside
and outside with cow-dung to fill up the cavities
and smooth the surface.<a id='r1212' /><a href='#f1212' class='c012'><sup>[1212]</sup></a> A more beautiful species
of hive was sometimes made with the lapis specularis,<a id='r1213' /><a href='#f1213' class='c012'><sup>[1213]</sup></a>
which, being almost as transparent as glass,
enabled the curious owner to contemplate the movements
and works of the bees.<a id='r1214' /><a href='#f1214' class='c012'><sup>[1214]</sup></a> When finished, they
were placed on projecting slabs, so as not to touch
or be easily shaken. There were generally three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>rows of hives rising above each other like Egyptian
tombs on the face of the wall, and there was a prejudice
against adding a fourth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fences of apiaries were made high and strong
to protect the inmates from the inroads of the bears,<a id='r1215' /><a href='#f1215' class='c012'><sup>[1215]</sup></a>
which would otherwise have overthrown the hives
and devoured all the combs.<a id='r1216' /><a href='#f1216' class='c012'><sup>[1216]</sup></a> Another enemy of the
bee was the Merops,<a id='r1217' /><a href='#f1217' class='c012'><sup>[1217]</sup></a> which makes its appearance
about Hymettos towards the end of summer.<a id='r1218' /><a href='#f1218' class='c012'><sup>[1218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There were, in ancient times, two entrances,
one on either hand, and on the top a lid, which
the Melitturgos could remove when he desired to
take the honey, or inspect the condition of the bees.
The best of these lids were made of bark, the worst
of earthenware, which were cold in winter, and in
summer exceedingly hot.<a id='r1219' /><a href='#f1219' class='c012'><sup>[1219]</sup></a> It was considered necessary
during spring and the succeeding season
for the bee-keeper to inspect the hives thrice a
month, to fumigate them slightly, and remove
all filth and vermin. He was careful, likewise, to
destroy the usurpers if there were more than one
queen,<a id='r1220' /><a href='#f1220' class='c012'><sup>[1220]</sup></a> since, in Varro’s<a id='r1221' /><a href='#f1221' class='c012'><sup>[1221]</sup></a> opinion, they gave rise to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>sedition; but Aristotle thinks there ought to be
several, lest one should die, and the hive along
with it. Of the queen bees there are three kinds,
the black, the ruddy, and the variegated; though
Menecrates, who is good authority, speaks only of
the black and variegated.<a id='r1222' /><a href='#f1222' class='c012'><sup>[1222]</sup></a> Aristotle, however, describes
the reddish queen bee as the best. Even
among the working insects there are two kinds, the
smaller, in form round, and variegated in colour,
the larger, which is the tame bee, less active and
beautiful. The former, or wild bee,<a id='r1223' /><a href='#f1223' class='c012'><sup>[1223]</sup></a> frequents the
mountains, forests, and other solitary places, labours
indefatigably, and collects honey in great quantities;
the latter, which feeds among gardens, and in man’s
neighbourhood, fills its hive more slowly.<a id='r1224' /><a href='#f1224' class='c012'><sup>[1224]</sup></a> With
respect to the drones, or males, which the working
bees generally expel at a certain time of the year,
the Attic melitturgi got rid of them in a very ingenious
manner. It was observed, that these gentlemen
though no way inclined to work, would yet
occasionally, on very fine days, go abroad for exercise,
rushing forth in squadrons, mounting aloft into
the air, and there wheeling, and sporting, and man&oelig;uvring
in the sun.<a id='r1225' /><a href='#f1225' class='c012'><sup>[1225]</sup></a> Taking advantage of their
absence, they spread a fine net over the hive-entrance,
the meshes of which, large enough to
admit the bee, would exclude the drone. On returning,
therefore, they found themselves, according
to the old saying, “on the smooth side of the door,”
and were compelled to seek fresh lodgings.<a id='r1226' /><a href='#f1226' class='c012'><sup>[1226]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In late springs, or when there is a drought or
blight, the bees breed very little, but make a great
deal of honey, whereas in wet seasons they keep
more at home, and attend to breeding. Swarms in
Greece<a id='r1227' /><a href='#f1227' class='c012'><sup>[1227]</sup></a> appeared about the ripening of the olive.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Aristotle is of opinion, that honey is not manufactured
by the bee, but falls perfectly formed from
the atmosphere, more especially at the heliacal rising
or setting of certain stars, and when the rainbow
appears. He observes, too, that no honey is found
before the rising of the Pleiades,<a id='r1228' /><a href='#f1228' class='c012'><sup>[1228]</sup></a> which happens
about the thirteenth of May.<a id='r1229' /><a href='#f1229' class='c012'><sup>[1229]</sup></a> This opinion is in
exact conformity with the fact, that at certain seasons
of the year what is called the honey dew descends,
covering thick the leaves of the oak, and
several other trees, which at such times literally
drop with honey. On these occasions the bees find
little to do beyond the labour of conveying it to
their cells, and, accordingly, have been known to
fill the hive in one or two days. It has been observed,
moreover, that autumn flowers, which yield
very little fragrance, yield, also, little or no honey.
In the kingdom of Pontos there was a race of white
bees which made honey twice a month; and at
Themiscyra there were those which built their combs
both in hives and in the earth, producing very little
wax, but a great deal of honey.<a id='r1230' /><a href='#f1230' class='c012'><sup>[1230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>When the time of year arrived for robbing the
bee, some hives were found to produce five, others
ten, others fifteen quarts of honey, still leaving sufficient
for winter consumption.<a id='r1231' /><a href='#f1231' class='c012'><sup>[1231]</sup></a> And in determining
what quantity would suffice great judgment was required;
for if too much remained the labourers grew
indolent, if too little they lost their spirits. However,
in this latter case the bee-keepers, having ascertained
that they were in need of food, introduced
a number of sweet figs, and other similar fruit into
the hive, as now we do moist sugar in a split cane.
Elsewhere the practice was to boil a number of
rich figs in water<a id='r1232' /><a href='#f1232' class='c012'><sup>[1232]</sup></a> till they were reduced to a jelly,
which was then formed into cakes and set near the
hive. Together with this, some bee-keepers placed
honey-water, wherein they threw locks of purple
wool, on which the bees might stand to drink.<a id='r1233' /><a href='#f1233' class='c012'><sup>[1233]</sup></a>
Certain melitturgi, desirous of distinguishing their
own bees<a id='r1234' /><a href='#f1234' class='c012'><sup>[1234]</sup></a> when spread over the meadows, sprinkled
them with fine flour. Mention is made of a person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>who obtained five thousand pounds’ weight of honey
annually; and Varro<a id='r1235' /><a href='#f1235' class='c012'><sup>[1235]</sup></a> speaks of two soldiers who,
with a small country house, and an acre of ground
left them by their father, realised an independent
fortune.</p>

<p class='c001'>Theophrastus, in a fragment<a id='r1236' /><a href='#f1236' class='c012'><sup>[1236]</sup></a> of one of his lost
works, speaks of three different kinds of honey, one
collected from flowers, another which, according to
his philosophy, descended pure from heaven, and a
third produced from canes. This last, which was
sometimes denominated Indian honey, is the sugar
of modern times. There appear, likewise, to have
been other kinds of sugar manufactured from different
substances, as Tamarisk and Wheat.<a id='r1237' /><a href='#f1237' class='c012'><sup>[1237]</sup></a> The
honey-dew, on the production of which the ancients<a id='r1238' /><a href='#f1238' class='c012'><sup>[1238]</sup></a>
held many extraordinary opinions, was supposed to
be superior to the nectar of the bee.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amyntas, in his Stations of Asia, cited by Athenæus,
gives a curious account of this sort of honey
which was collected in various parts of the East,
particularly in Syria. In some cases they gathered
the leaves of the tree, chiefly the linden and the
oak, on which the dew was most abundantly<a id='r1239' /><a href='#f1239' class='c012'><sup>[1239]</sup></a> found,
and pressed them together like those masses of Syrian
figs, which were called <em>palathè</em>. Others allowed
it to drop from the leaves and harden into globules,
which, when desirous of using, they broke,
and, having poured water thereon in wooden bowls
called <em>tabaitas</em>, drank the mixture. In the districts
of Mount Lebanon<a id='r1240' /><a href='#f1240' class='c012'><sup>[1240]</sup></a> the honey-dew fell plentifully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>several times during the year, and was collected
by spreading skins under the trees, and shaking
into them the liquid honey from the leaves; they
then filled therewith numerous vessels, in which it
was preserved for use. On these occasions, the
peasants used to exclaim, “Zeus has been raining
honey!”</p>

i. 2. 1. Offensive smells are
often reckoned among the aversions
of bees, but I fear without
good reason. At least they have
sometimes been found to select
strange places wherein to deposit
their treasures of sweets. In the
book of Judges, chap. xiv. ver. 8,
seq., it is related that, when Samson,
on his way to Timnath,
turned aside to view the carcass
of a young lion which he had a
short time previously slain, “behold,
there was a swarm of bees
and honey in the carcass of the
lion, and he took thereof in his
hands and went on eating, and
came to his father and mother,
and he gave them and they
did eat, but he told not them
that he had taken the honey
out of the carcass of the lion.”
Upon this passage the following
may serve as a note:—“Among
this pretty collection
of natural curiosities, (in the
cemetery of Algesiras,) one in
particular attracted our attention;
this was the contents of a
small uncovered coffin in which
lay a child, the cavity of the
chest exposed and tenanted by
an industrious colony of bees.
The comb was rapidly progressing,
and I suppose, according to
the adage of the poet, they were
adding sweets to the sweet, if
not perfume to the violet.”

In the island of Cuba, where the
tame bee was originally introduced
by the English, it has been
found to swarm and multiply
with incredible rapidity, each
hive sometimes sending forth two
swarms per month, so that the
mountains are absolutely filled
with them. This rapid increase
seems to have taken place chiefly
in the neighbourhood of the sugar
plantations, which they were long
since supposed to deteriorate by
extracting too much honey from
the cane. Don Ulloa, Memoires

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER II. <br /> GARDEN AND ORCHARD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Lord Bacon, who loved to be surrounded by plants
and trees and flowers, delivers it as his opinion,
that the scientific culture of gardens affords a surer
mark of the advance of civilisation than any improvement
in the science of architecture, since men, he
observes, enjoyed the luxury of magnificent palaces
before that of picturesque and well-ordered garden-grounds.
This, likewise, was the conviction of the
ancient Greeks,<a id='r1241' /><a href='#f1241' class='c012'><sup>[1241]</sup></a> in whose literature we everywhere
discover vestiges of a passion for that voluptuous
solitude which men taste in artificial and secluded
plantations, amid flower-beds and arbours and hanging
vines and fountains and smooth shady walks.
No full description, however, of an Hellenic garden
has survived; even the poets have contented
themselves with affording us glimpses of their “studious
walks and shades.” We must, therefore, endeavour,
by the aid of scattered hints, chance expressions,
fragments, and a careful study of the natural
and invariable productions of the country, to work
out for ourselves a picture of what the gardens of
Peisistratos, or Cimon, or Pericles, or Epicurus,
whom Pliny<a id='r1242' /><a href='#f1242' class='c012'><sup>[1242]</sup></a> denominates the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>magister hortorum</i></span>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>any other Grecian gentleman, must in the best ages
have been.</p>

<p class='c001'>That portion of the ground<a id='r1243' /><a href='#f1243' class='c012'><sup>[1243]</sup></a> which was devoted
to the culture of sweet-smelling shrubs and flowers,
usually approached and projected inwards between
the back wings of the house, so that from the windows
the eye might alight upon the rich and variegated
tints of the parterres<a id='r1244' /><a href='#f1244' class='c012'><sup>[1244]</sup></a> intermingled with verdure,
while the evening and morning breeze wafted
clouds of fragrance into the apartments.<a id='r1245' /><a href='#f1245' class='c012'><sup>[1245]</sup></a> The lawns,
shrubberies, bosquets, thickets, arcades, and avenues,
were, in most cases, laid out in a picturesque though
artificial manner, the principal object appearing to
have been to combine use with magnificence, and
to enjoy all the blended hues and odours which the
plants and trees acclimated in Hellas could afford.
Protection, in summer, from the sun’s rays, is, in those
southern latitudes, an almost necessary ingredient
of pleasure, and, therefore, numerous trees, as the
cedar,<a id='r1246' /><a href='#f1246' class='c012'><sup>[1246]</sup></a> the cypress, the black and white poplar,<a id='r1247' /><a href='#f1247' class='c012'><sup>[1247]</sup></a> the
ash, the linden, the elm, and the platane, rose here
and there in the grounds, in some places singly, elsewhere
in clumps, uniting their branches above, and
affording a cool and dense shade. Beneath these
umbrageous arches the air was further refrigerated
by splashing fountains,<a id='r1248' /><a href='#f1248' class='c012'><sup>[1248]</sup></a> whose waters, through numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>fair channels, straight or winding, as the use
demanded of them required,<a id='r1249' /><a href='#f1249' class='c012'><sup>[1249]</sup></a> spread themselves over
the whole garden, refreshing the eye and keeping
up a perpetual verdure. Copses of myrtles, of roses,
of agnus-castus,<a id='r1250' /><a href='#f1250' class='c012'><sup>[1250]</sup></a> and other odoriferous shrubs intermingled,
clustering round a pomegranate-tree, were
usually placed on elevated spots,<a id='r1251' /><a href='#f1251' class='c012'><sup>[1251]</sup></a> that, being thus
exposed to the winds, they might the more freely
diffuse their sweetness. The spaces between trees
were sometimes planted with roses,<a id='r1252' /><a href='#f1252' class='c012'><sup>[1252]</sup></a> and lilies, and
violets, and golden crocuses;<a id='r1253' /><a href='#f1253' class='c012'><sup>[1253]</sup></a> and sometimes presented
a breadth of smooth, close, green sward,
sprinkled with wild-flowers, as the violet and the blue
veronica,<a id='r1254' /><a href='#f1254' class='c012'><sup>[1254]</sup></a> the pink, and the pale primrose, the golden
motherwort, the cowslip, the daisy, the pimpernel,
and the periwinkle. In many gardens the custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>was, to plant each kind of tree in separate groups,
and each species of flower-bed also had, as now in
Holland,<a id='r1255' /><a href='#f1255' class='c012'><sup>[1255]</sup></a> a distinct space assigned to it; so that
there were beds of white violets,<a id='r1256' /><a href='#f1256' class='c012'><sup>[1256]</sup></a> of irises, of the
golden cynosure,<a id='r1257' /><a href='#f1257' class='c012'><sup>[1257]</sup></a> of hyacinths, of ranunculuses, of
the blue campanula, or Canterbury bells, of white
gilliflowers, carnations, and the branchy asphodel.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>One of the principal causes which induced the
Greeks to attend to the culture of ornamental shrubs
and flowers, was the perpetual use made of them in
crowns and garlands.<a id='r1258' /><a href='#f1258' class='c012'><sup>[1258]</sup></a> Nearly all their ceremonies,
whether civil or religious, were performed by individuals
wearing certain wreaths about their brow.
Thus the Spartans, during the Promachian festival,<a id='r1259' /><a href='#f1259' class='c012'><sup>[1259]</sup></a>
shaded their foreheads with plaited tufts of reeds—priests
and priestesses, soothsayers,<a id='r1260' /><a href='#f1260' class='c012'><sup>[1260]</sup></a> prophets, and enchanters,
appeared in their several capacities before
the gods in temples or sacred groves with symbolical
crowns encircling their heads, as the priests of
Hera, at Samos, with laurel,<a id='r1261' /><a href='#f1261' class='c012'><sup>[1261]</sup></a> and those of Aphrodite
with myrtle,<a id='r1262' /><a href='#f1262' class='c012'><sup>[1262]</sup></a> while the statues of the divinities themselves
were often crowned with circlets of these
“earthly stars.” In the festival of Europa, at Corinth,
a crown of myrtle, thirty feet in circumference,
was borne in procession through the city.<a id='r1263' /><a href='#f1263' class='c012'><sup>[1263]</sup></a> The actors,
dancers, and spectators of the theatre usually
appeared crowned with flowers,<a id='r1264' /><a href='#f1264' class='c012'><sup>[1264]</sup></a> as did every guest
at an entertainment, while lovers suspended a profusion
of garlands on the doors of their mistresses,
as did the devout on the temples and altars of the
gods.<a id='r1265' /><a href='#f1265' class='c012'><sup>[1265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Most of the flowers cultivated, moreover, suggested
poetical or mythological associations; for the
religion of Greece combined itself with nearly every
object in nature, more particularly with the beautiful,
so that the Greek, as he strolled through his
garden, had perpetually before his fancy a succession
of fables connected with nymphs and goddesses and
the old hereditary traditions of his county. Thus
the laurel recalled the tale and transformation
of Daphnè,<a id='r1266' /><a href='#f1266' class='c012'><sup>[1266]</sup></a> the object of Apollo’s love—the cypresses
or graces of the vegetable kingdom,<a id='r1267' /><a href='#f1267' class='c012'><sup>[1267]</sup></a> were the everlasting
representatives of Eteocles’ daughters, visited
by death because they dared to rival the goddesses
in dancing—the myrtle<a id='r1268' /><a href='#f1268' class='c012'><sup>[1268]</sup></a> was a most beautiful maiden
of Attica, fairer than all her countrywomen, swifter
and more patient of toil than the youth, who therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>slew her through envy—the pine<a id='r1269' /><a href='#f1269' class='c012'><sup>[1269]</sup></a> was the tall
and graceful mistress of Pan and Boreas—the mint
that of Pluto—while the rose-campion sprung from
the bath of Aphrodite, and the humble cabbage from
the tears of Lycurgus, the enemy of Dionysos.<a id='r1270' /><a href='#f1270' class='c012'><sup>[1270]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has sometimes been supposed,<a id='r1271' /><a href='#f1271' class='c012'><sup>[1271]</sup></a> that the flower
which constitutes the greatest ornament of gardens
was wholly unknown in the early ages of Greece.
But this theory, imagined for the purpose of destroying
the claims of the Anacreontic fragments to
be considered genuine,<a id='r1272' /><a href='#f1272' class='c012'><sup>[1272]</sup></a> is entirely overthrown by
the testimony of several ancient writers, more particularly
Herodotus,<a id='r1273' /><a href='#f1273' class='c012'><sup>[1273]</sup></a> who speaks of the rose of sixty
leaves, as found in the gardens of Midas in Thrace,
at the foot of the snowy Bermios. Elswhere, too,
he compares the flower of the red Niliac lotus<a id='r1274' /><a href='#f1274' class='c012'><sup>[1274]</sup></a> to
the rose; and Stesichoros,<a id='r1275' /><a href='#f1275' class='c012'><sup>[1275]</sup></a> an older poet than Anacreon,
distinctly mentions chaplets composed of this flower.</p>

<p class='c014'>Homer,<a id='r1276' /><a href='#f1276' class='c012'><sup>[1276]</sup></a> too, it is evident, was familiar with the
rose, to whose fragrant petals he compares the
fingers of the morning, and not, as has been imagined,
to the blood-red flower of the wild pomegranate
tree.<a id='r1277' /><a href='#f1277' class='c012'><sup>[1277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>According, moreover, to a tradition preserved to
later times, the seasons of the year, which in remote
antiquity were but three, they symbolically represented
by a rose, an ear of corn, and an apple.<a id='r1278' /><a href='#f1278' class='c012'><sup>[1278]</sup></a>
This division is thought to have been borrowed
from the Egyptians, in whose country, however, the
apple was never sufficiently naturalised to be taken
as an emblem of one of the seasons of the year.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, at whatever period the rose began to be
cultivated, it evidently, as soon as known, shared
with the violet the admiration of the Athenian people,
whose extensive plantations of this most fragrant
shrub recall to mind the rose gardens of the Fayoum,
or Serinaghur. The secret, moreover, was early
discovered of hastening or retarding their maturity,
so as to obtain an abundant supply through every
month in the year.<a id='r1279' /><a href='#f1279' class='c012'><sup>[1279]</sup></a> Occasionally, too, numbers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>rosebuds were laid among green barleystalks, plucked
up by the roots, in unglazed amphoræ, to be brought
forth and made to blow when wanted. Others deposited
them between layers of the same material
on the ground, or dipped them in the liquid dregs
of olives. Another mode of preserving the rose was
exceedingly curious,—cutting off the top of a large
standing reed, and splitting it down a little way,
they inserted a number of rosebuds in the hollow,
and then bound it softly round and atop with papyrus
in order to prevent their fragrance from exhaling.<a id='r1280' /><a href='#f1280' class='c012'><sup>[1280]</sup></a>
How many varieties of this flower<a id='r1281' /><a href='#f1281' class='c012'><sup>[1281]</sup></a> were
possessed by the ancients it is now, perhaps, impossible
to determine; but they were acquainted
with the common, the white, and the moss rose,
the last, in Aristotle’s<a id='r1282' /><a href='#f1282' class='c012'><sup>[1282]</sup></a> opinion, the sweetest, together
with the rose of a hundred leaves,<a id='r1283' /><a href='#f1283' class='c012'><sup>[1283]</sup></a> celebrated
by the Persian poets. Even the wild rose was not
wholly inodorous in Greece.<a id='r1284' /><a href='#f1284' class='c012'><sup>[1284]</sup></a> Roses were artificially
blanched by being exposed while unfolding to
powerful and repeated fumigations with sulphur.<a id='r1285' /><a href='#f1285' class='c012'><sup>[1285]</sup></a>
The roses which grew on a dry soil were supposed
to be the sweetest, while their fragrance
was augmented by planting garlic near the root.<a id='r1286' /><a href='#f1286' class='c012'><sup>[1286]</sup></a>
To cause them to bloom in January, or in early
spring (for even in the most southern parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Greece the rose season only commences in April)<a id='r1287' /><a href='#f1287' class='c012'><sup>[1287]</sup></a>
various means were resorted to; sometimes, the
bushes were watered twice a-day during the whole
summer; on other occasions, a shallow trench was
dug at a distance of about eighteen inches round
the bush, into which warm water was poured
morning and evening;<a id='r1288' /><a href='#f1288' class='c012'><sup>[1288]</sup></a> while a third, and, perhaps,
the surest, method was to plant them in pots, or
baskets, which, during the winter months, were
placed in sheltered sunny spots by day,<a id='r1289' /><a href='#f1289' class='c012'><sup>[1289]</sup></a> and carried
into the house at night; afterwards, when the season
was sufficiently advanced, these portable gardens
were buried in the earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another favorite denizen of Hellenic gardens was
the lily, which, probably, introduced from Suza or
from Egypt, beheld the virginal snow of its bells compelled,
by art, to put on various hues, as deep red
and purple,<a id='r1290' /><a href='#f1290' class='c012'><sup>[1290]</sup></a>—the former, by infusing, before planting,
cinnabar into the bulb,—the latter, by steeping it
in the lees of purple wine. This flower naturally
begins to bloom<a id='r1291' /><a href='#f1291' class='c012'><sup>[1291]</sup></a> just as the roses are fading; but,
to produce a succession of lilies at different seasons,
some were set near the surface, which grew up and
blossomed immediately, while others were buried at
different depths, according to the times at which
they were required to flower.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along with these, about the dank borders of
streams or fountains, grew the favourite flower of
the Athenian people, purple, double, white, and gold,<a id='r1292' /><a href='#f1292' class='c012'><sup>[1292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>How many of the lovely evergreens<a id='r1310' /><a href='#f1310' class='c012'><sup>[1310]</sup></a> that abound
in Greece were usually cultivated in a single garden,
we possess no means of ascertaining, though all appear
occasionally to have been called in to diversify
the picture. The myrtle,<a id='r1311' /><a href='#f1311' class='c012'><sup>[1311]</sup></a> whose deep blue berries
were esteemed a delicacy,<a id='r1312' /><a href='#f1312' class='c012'><sup>[1312]</sup></a> in some places rose into
a tree, while elsewhere it was planted thick, and bent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>and fashioned into bowers,<a id='r1313' /><a href='#f1313' class='c012'><sup>[1313]</sup></a> which, when sprinkled
with its snowy blossoms, combined, perhaps, with
those of the jasmine, the eglantine, and the yellow
tufts of the broad-leaved philyrea,<a id='r1314' /><a href='#f1314' class='c012'><sup>[1314]</sup></a> constituted some
of the most beautiful objects in a Greek paradise.
Thickets of the tamarisk,<a id='r1315' /><a href='#f1315' class='c012'><sup>[1315]</sup></a> the strawberry-tree,<a id='r1316' /><a href='#f1316' class='c012'><sup>[1316]</sup></a> the
juniper, the box, the bay, the styrax, the andrachne,
and the white-flowered laurel, in whose dark leaves
the morning dew collects and glistens in the sun like
so many tiny mirrors of burnished silver, varied the
surface of the lawn, connecting the bowers, and the
copses, and the flower beds, and the grassy slopes
with those loftier piles of verdure, consisting of the
pine tree, the smilax, the cedar, the carob, the
maple,<a id='r1317' /><a href='#f1317' class='c012'><sup>[1317]</sup></a> the ash, the elm tree, the platane,<a id='r1318' /><a href='#f1318' class='c012'><sup>[1318]</sup></a> and
the evergreen oak which here and there towered
in the grounds. In many places the vine shot up
among the ranges of elms or platanes, and stretched
its long twisted arm from trunk to trunk, like
so many festoons of intermingled leaves and tendrils,
and massive clusters of golden or purple
grapes.<a id='r1319' /><a href='#f1319' class='c012'><sup>[1319]</sup></a> Alternating, perhaps, with the lovely favourite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of Dionysos, the blue and yellow clematis<a id='r1320' /><a href='#f1320' class='c012'><sup>[1320]</sup></a>
suspended their living garlands around the stems,
or along the boughs of the trees, in union or contrast
with the dodder, or the honeysuckle, or the
delicate and slender briony. And, if perchance a
silver fir, with its bright yellow flowers,<a id='r1321' /><a href='#f1321' class='c012'><sup>[1321]</sup></a> formed part
of the group, large pendant clusters of mistletoe,
the food sometimes of the labouring ox,<a id='r1322' /><a href='#f1322' class='c012'><sup>[1322]</sup></a> might frequently
be seen swinging thick among its branches.
In some grounds was probably cultivated the quercus
suber,<a id='r1323' /><a href='#f1323' class='c012'><sup>[1323]</sup></a> or cork tree, with bark four or five
inches thick, triennially stripped off,<a id='r1324' /><a href='#f1324' class='c012'><sup>[1324]</sup></a> after which
it grows again with renewed vigour. Occasionally,
where streams and rivulets<a id='r1325' /><a href='#f1325' class='c012'><sup>[1325]</sup></a> found their way through
the grounds, the black and white poplar, the willow,
and the lentiscus, with a variety of tufted reeds,
crowded about the margin, here and there shading
and concealing the waters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Proceeding now into the orchard we find, that,
instead of walls, it was, sometimes at least, if it
touched on the confines of another man’s grounds,
surrounded by hedges<a id='r1326' /><a href='#f1326' class='c012'><sup>[1326]</sup></a> of black and white thorn,
brambles, and barberry bushes, as at present<a id='r1327' /><a href='#f1327' class='c012'><sup>[1327]</sup></a> by impenetrable
fences of the Indian cactus.<a id='r1328' /><a href='#f1328' class='c012'><sup>[1328]</sup></a> On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>banks of these hedges, both inside and out, were
found, peculiar tribes of plants and wild flowers, in
some places enamelling the smooth close turf, elsewhere
flourishing thickly in dank masses of verdure,
or climbing upwards and interlacing themselves with
the lofty and projecting thorns, such as the enchanter’s
nightshade, the euphorbia, the iris tuberosa, the
red-flowered valerian, the ground-ivy,<a id='r1329' /><a href='#f1329' class='c012'><sup>[1329]</sup></a> the physalis
somnifera, with its coral red seeds in their inflated
calyces,<a id='r1330' /><a href='#f1330' class='c012'><sup>[1330]</sup></a> the globularia, the creeping heliotrope, the
penny-cress,<a id='r1331' /><a href='#f1331' class='c012'><sup>[1331]</sup></a> the bright yellow scorpion-flower, and
the broad-leaved cyclamen or our Lady’s-seal, with
pink flower, light green leaf, veined with white and
yellow beneath. The ancient Parthians surrounded
their gardens with hedges of a fragrant, creeping
shrub denominated philadelphos or love-brother,<a id='r1332' /><a href='#f1332' class='c012'><sup>[1332]</sup></a>
whose long suckers they interwove into a kind of
network forming a sufficient protection against man
and beast. In mountainous districts, where rain-floods
were to be guarded against, the enclosures
frequently consisted of walls of loose stones,<a id='r1333' /><a href='#f1333' class='c012'><sup>[1333]</sup></a> as is
still the case in Savoy on the edge of mountain
torrents.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was moreover the custom, both in Greece and
Italy, to plant, on the boundary line of estates, rows
of olives or other trees,<a id='r1334' /><a href='#f1334' class='c012'><sup>[1334]</sup></a> which not only served to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>mark the limits of a man’s territory, but shed an
air of beauty over the whole country. A proof of
this practice prevailing in Attica, has with much
ingenuity<a id='r1335' /><a href='#f1335' class='c012'><sup>[1335]</sup></a> been brought forward from the “Frogs,”
where Bacchos, addressing the poet Æschylus in
the shades, observes “It will be all right provided
your anger does not transport you beyond the olives.”
It may likewise be remarked that in olive-grounds,<a id='r1336' /><a href='#f1336' class='c012'><sup>[1336]</sup></a>
the trees, excepting the sacred ones called <em>moriæ</em>,
were always planted in straight lines, from twenty-five
to thirty feet<a id='r1337' /><a href='#f1337' class='c012'><sup>[1337]</sup></a> apart, because, in order to ripen
the fruit,<a id='r1338' /><a href='#f1338' class='c012'><sup>[1338]</sup></a> it is necessary that the wind should be
able freely to play upon it from all sides. And
further because they delight in a warm dry air like
that of Libya, Cilicia,<a id='r1339' /><a href='#f1339' class='c012'><sup>[1339]</sup></a> and Attica, the best olive-grounds
were generally supposed to be those which
occupied the rapid slopes of hills where the soil is
naturally stony and light. The oil of the plains was
commonly coarse and thick.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among these olive grounds in summer, the song
of the tettix<a id='r1340' /><a href='#f1340' class='c012'><sup>[1340]</sup></a> is commonly heard; for this musical
insect loves the olive, which, like the sant of the
Arabian desert, yields but a thin and warm shade.<a id='r1341' /><a href='#f1341' class='c012'><sup>[1341]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>The tettix, in fact, though never found in an unwooded
country, as in the plains about Cyrene,
equally avoids the dense shade of the woods.<a id='r1342' /><a href='#f1342' class='c012'><sup>[1342]</sup></a> Here
likewise<a id='r1343' /><a href='#f1343' class='c012'><sup>[1343]</sup></a> are found the blackbird, the roller, and
three distinct species of butcher-bird—the small grey,
the ash-coloured, and the redheaded.</p>

<p class='c001'>In an Attic orchard were most of the trees reared
in England, together with many which will not stand
the rigour of our climate.—The apple,<a id='r1344' /><a href='#f1344' class='c012'><sup>[1344]</sup></a> cultivated
with peculiar care in the environs of Delphi and
Corinth; the pear,<a id='r1345' /><a href='#f1345' class='c012'><sup>[1345]</sup></a> the cherry from Cerasos on the
southern shore of the Black Sea,<a id='r1346' /><a href='#f1346' class='c012'><sup>[1346]</sup></a> which sometimes
grew to the height of nearly forty feet,<a id='r1347' /><a href='#f1347' class='c012'><sup>[1347]</sup></a> the damascene,<a id='r1348' /><a href='#f1348' class='c012'><sup>[1348]</sup></a>
and the common plum. Along with these
were likewise to be found the quince,<a id='r1349' /><a href='#f1349' class='c012'><sup>[1349]</sup></a> the apricot,
the peach, the nectarine, the walnut, the chestnut,
the filbert, introduced from Pontos,<a id='r1350' /><a href='#f1350' class='c012'><sup>[1350]</sup></a> the hazel nut,
the medlar, and the mulberry, which, according to
Menander, is the earliest fruit of the year.<a id='r1351' /><a href='#f1351' class='c012'><sup>[1351]</sup></a> With
these were intermingled the fig, white, purple, and
red, the pomegranate,<a id='r1352' /><a href='#f1352' class='c012'><sup>[1352]</sup></a> from the northern shores of
Africa, the orange,<a id='r1353' /><a href='#f1353' class='c012'><sup>[1353]</sup></a> still planted under artificial shelter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>at Lemnos, the citron, the lemon,<a id='r1354' /><a href='#f1354' class='c012'><sup>[1354]</sup></a> the date-palm,<a id='r1355' /><a href='#f1355' class='c012'><sup>[1355]</sup></a>
the pistachio, the almond, the service, and
the cornel-tree.</p>

<p class='c001'>As these gardens were arranged with a view no
less to pleasure than to profit, the trees were planted
in lines, which, when sufficiently close, formed
a series of umbrageous avenues, opening here into
the lawn and there into the vineyard, which generally
formed part of a Greek gentleman’s grounds.
And such an orchard decked in its summer pride
with foliage of emerald and fruit, ruddy, purple, and
gold, the notes of the thrush, the nightingale,<a id='r1356' /><a href='#f1356' class='c012'><sup>[1356]</sup></a> the
tettix, with the “amorous thrill of the green-finch,”<a id='r1357' /><a href='#f1357' class='c012'><sup>[1357]</sup></a>
floating through its boughs, and the perfume of the
agnus-castus, the myrtle, the rose, and the violet,
wafting richly on all sides, was a very paradise.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not unfrequently, common foot-paths traversed
these orchards and vineyards, in which case the
passers-by were customarily, if not by law, permitted
to pick and eat the fruit,<a id='r1358' /><a href='#f1358' class='c012'><sup>[1358]</sup></a> which seems also
from the account of our Saviour to have been the
practice in Judæa. The contrary is the case in
modern Europe. In Burgundy and Switzerland,
where pathways traverse vineyards, it is not uncommon
to see the grapes smeared with something
resembling white lime which children are assured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>is a deadly poison. This, while in the country, I
regarded as a mere stratagem, intended to protect
the vineyards from depredation, though there seems
after all to be too much reason to believe the nefarious
practice to exist in several localities. At
least two children were recently killed at Foix by
eating poisoned grapes on the way-side.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks placed much of their happiness in
spots like those we have been describing, as may
be inferred from such of their fabulous traditions,<a id='r1359' /><a href='#f1359' class='c012'><sup>[1359]</sup></a>
as relate to the garden of the Hesperides,<a id='r1360' /><a href='#f1360' class='c012'><sup>[1360]</sup></a>
the gardens of Midas, with their magnificent roses,
and those of Alcinoös,<a id='r1361' /><a href='#f1361' class='c012'><sup>[1361]</sup></a> which still shed their fragrance
over the pages of the Odyssey. From the
East, no doubt, they obtained, along with their noblest
fruit-trees, the art of cultivating them, and,
perhaps, that sacred tradition of the Garden of
Eden, preserved in the Scriptures, formed the basis
of many a Hellenic legend.<a id='r1362' /><a href='#f1362' class='c012'><sup>[1362]</sup></a> The Syrians acquired
much celebrity among the ancients for their knowledge
of gardening, in which, according to modern
travellers, they still excel. Of the manner of cultivating
fruit-trees in the earlier ages very little is
known. No doubt they soon discovered that some
will thrive better in certain soils and situations than
in others, and profited by the discovery; but the
art of properly training and grafting trees is comparatively
modern.<a id='r1363' /><a href='#f1363' class='c012'><sup>[1363]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>No mention of it occurs in the Pentateuch, though
Moses there gives directions how to manage an orchard.
For the first three years the blossoms were
not to be suffered to ripen into fruit, and even in
the fourth all that came was sacred to the Lord.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>From the fifth year, onward, they might do with
it what they pleased. Of these regulations the intention
was to prevent the early exhaustion of the
trees. Homer, also, is silent on the practice of
grafting, nor does any mention of it occur in the
extant works of Hesiod, though Manilius<a id='r1364' /><a href='#f1364' class='c012'><sup>[1364]</sup></a> refers to
his poems in proof of the antiquity of the practice.
By degrees, however, it got into use;<a id='r1365' /><a href='#f1365' class='c012'><sup>[1365]</sup></a> and, in the
age of Aristotle,<a id='r1366' /><a href='#f1366' class='c012'><sup>[1366]</sup></a> was already common, as at present
almost everywhere, save in Greece,<a id='r1367' /><a href='#f1367' class='c012'><sup>[1367]</sup></a> since no fruit
was esteemed excellent unless the tree had been
grafted. Some few of the rules they observed in
this process may be briefly noticed.<a id='r1368' /><a href='#f1368' class='c012'><sup>[1368]</sup></a> Trees with a
thick rind were grafted in the ordinary way, and
sometimes by inserting the graft between the bark
and the wood, which was called infoliation.<a id='r1369' /><a href='#f1369' class='c012'><sup>[1369]</sup></a> Inoculation,
also, or introducing the bud of one tree into
the rind of another, was common among Greek gardeners.<a id='r1370' /><a href='#f1370' class='c012'><sup>[1370]</sup></a>
They were extremely particular in their

pears,) the almond, and the terebinth; apples<a id='r1374' /><a href='#f1374' class='c012'><sup>[1374]</sup></a> on
all sorts of wild pears and quinces, (whence the
finest apples called by the Athenians Melimela,)<a id='r1375' /><a href='#f1375' class='c012'><sup>[1375]</sup></a>
on damascenes, also, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>, and on the
platane, (whence red apples.)<a id='r1376' /><a href='#f1376' class='c012'><sup>[1376]</sup></a> Another method of
communicating a blush to this fruit was to plant
rose-bushes round the root of the tree.<a id='r1377' /><a href='#f1377' class='c012'><sup>[1377]</sup></a> The walnut
was grafted on the strawberry-tree only;<a id='r1378' /><a href='#f1378' class='c012'><sup>[1378]</sup></a> the pomegranate
on the myrtle<a id='r1379' /><a href='#f1379' class='c012'><sup>[1379]</sup></a> and the willow; the laurel
on the cherry<a id='r1380' /><a href='#f1380' class='c012'><sup>[1380]</sup></a> and the ash; the white peach on
the damascene and the almond; the damascene on
the wild pear, the quince, and the apple; chestnuts
on the walnut, the beech, and the oak;<a id='r1381' /><a href='#f1381' class='c012'><sup>[1381]</sup></a> the cherry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>on the terebinth, and the peach; the quince on the
oxyacanthus; the myrtle on the willow; and the
apricot on the damascene, and the Thasian almond-tree.
The vine, also, was grafted on a cherry and
a myrtle-stock, which produced, in the first case,
grapes in spring,<a id='r1382' /><a href='#f1382' class='c012'><sup>[1382]</sup></a> in the second, a mixed fruit, between
the myrtle-berry and the grape.<a id='r1383' /><a href='#f1383' class='c012'><sup>[1383]</sup></a> When the
gardener desired to obtain black citrons, he inserted
a citron-graft into an apple-stock, and, if red, into
a mulberry-stock.</p>

<p class='c001'>Citrons were likewise occasionally grafted on the
pomegranate-tree. In the present day, the almond,
the chestnut, the fig, the orange, and the citron,
with many other species of fruit-trees, are no longer
thought to require grafting.<a id='r1384' /><a href='#f1384' class='c012'><sup>[1384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In illustration of the prolific virtue of the Hellenic
soil it may be mentioned, that young branchless
pear-trees, transplanted from Malta to the neighbourhood
of Athens, in the autumn of 1830, were the
next year covered thick with fruit, which hung
even upon the trunk like hanks of onions.<a id='r1385' /><a href='#f1385' class='c012'><sup>[1385]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Notwithstanding the early season of the year at
which Gaia distributes her gifts in Greece, numerous
arts were resorted to for anticipating the productions
of summer,<a id='r1386' /><a href='#f1386' class='c012'><sup>[1386]</sup></a> though of most of them the nature
is unknown. It is certain, however, that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>possessed the means of ripening fruits throughout
the winter, either by hothouses or other contrivances
equally efficacious.<a id='r1387' /><a href='#f1387' class='c012'><sup>[1387]</sup></a> During the festival celebrated
in honour of the lover of Aphrodite, the seeds of
flowers were sown in those silver pots, or baskets,
called the gardens of Adonis,<a id='r1388' /><a href='#f1388' class='c012'><sup>[1388]</sup></a> and with artificial
heat and constant irrigation compelled to bloom in
eight days. Among the modern Hindus corn is still
forced to spring up in a few days, by a similar
process, during the festival of Gouri.<a id='r1389' /><a href='#f1389' class='c012'><sup>[1389]</sup></a> To produce
rathe figs,<a id='r1390' /><a href='#f1390' class='c012'><sup>[1390]</sup></a> a manure, composed of dove’s dung
and pepper and oil, was laid about the roots of the
tree. Another method was that which is still employed
under the name of caprification, alluded to
by Sophocles.<a id='r1391' /><a href='#f1391' class='c012'><sup>[1391]</sup></a> For this purpose care was taken to
rear, close at hand, several wild fig-trees, from which
might be obtained the flies made use of in this process,<a id='r1392' /><a href='#f1392' class='c012'><sup>[1392]</sup></a>
performed by cutting off bunches of wild figs
and suspending them amid the branches of the cultivated
species,<a id='r1393' /><a href='#f1393' class='c012'><sup>[1393]</sup></a> when a fly issuing from the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>pricked the slowly ripening fruit and accelerated its
maturity.<a id='r1394' /><a href='#f1394' class='c012'><sup>[1394]</sup></a> In growing the various kinds of fig they
were careful to plant the Chelidonian, the Erinean, or
wild fig, the Leukerinean, and the Phibaleian<a id='r1395' /><a href='#f1395' class='c012'><sup>[1395]</sup></a> on
plains. The autumn-royals would grow anywhere.
Each sort has its peculiar excellence. The following
were the best: the colouroi, or truncated, the forminion,
the diforoi, the Megaric, and the Laconian,
which would bear abundantly if well-watered.<a id='r1396' /><a href='#f1396' class='c012'><sup>[1396]</sup></a>
Rhodes was famous for its excellent figs, which
were even thought worthy to be compared with
those of Attica.<a id='r1397' /><a href='#f1397' class='c012'><sup>[1397]</sup></a> Athenæus, however, pretends that
the best figs in the world were found at Rome.
There were figs with a ruddy bloom in the island
of Paros, the same in kind as the Lydian fig.<a id='r1398' /><a href='#f1398' class='c012'><sup>[1398]</sup></a>
The Leukerinean produced the white fig.<a id='r1399' /><a href='#f1399' class='c012'><sup>[1399]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The fancy of Hellenic gardeners amused itself
with effecting numerous fantastic changes in the
appearance and nature of fruit. Thus citrons, lemons,
&amp;c., were made, by the application of a clay
mould, to assume the form of the human face, of
birds and other animals.<a id='r1400' /><a href='#f1400' class='c012'><sup>[1400]</sup></a> Occasionally, too, they were
introduced, when small, into the neck of a bottle
provided with breathing holes, the figure of which
they assumed as they projected their growth into
all its dimensions. We are assured, moreover, that,
by a very simple process, they could produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>peaches, almonds,<a id='r1401' /><a href='#f1401' class='c012'><sup>[1401]</sup></a> &amp;c., covered, as though by magic,
with written characters. The mode of operation
was this,—steeping the stone of the fruit in water for
several days, they then carefully divided it, and taking
out the kernel inscribed upon it with a brazen pen
whatever words or letters they thought proper. This
done, they again closed the stone over the kernel,
bound it round with papyrus, and planted it; and
the peaches or almonds which afterwards grew on
that tree bore every one of them, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mirabile dictu!</i></span>
the legend inscribed upon the kernel. By similar
arts<a id='r1402' /><a href='#f1402' class='c012'><sup>[1402]</sup></a> they created stoneless peaches, walnuts without
husks, figs white one side, and black the other, and
converted bitter almonds into sweet.<a id='r1403' /><a href='#f1403' class='c012'><sup>[1403]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The rules observed in the planting of fruit-trees
were numerous.<a id='r1404' /><a href='#f1404' class='c012'><sup>[1404]</sup></a> Some, they were of opinion, were
best propagated by seed, others by suckers wrenched
from the root of the parent stock,<a id='r1405' /><a href='#f1405' class='c012'><sup>[1405]</sup></a> others, again, by
branches selected from among the new wood on the
topmost boughs. A rude practice, too, common
enough in our own rural districts, appears to have
been in much favour among them,—bending some
long pendant bough to the ground, they covered
a part of it with heavy clods, allowing, however, the
extremity to appear above the earth. When it had
taken root it was severed from the tree and transplanted
to some proper situation. At other times,
the points of boughs were drawn down and fixed
in the ground, which even thus took root, and sent
the juices backwards, after which the bough was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>cut off and a new stock produced. Trees generated
by this method, as well as those planted during
the waning moon,<a id='r1406' /><a href='#f1406' class='c012'><sup>[1406]</sup></a> were supposed to spread and
grow branchy, while those set during the waxing
moon attained, though weaker, to a much greater
height. It ought, perhaps, to be further added,
that all seeds and plants were put into the ground
while the moon was below the horizon.<a id='r1407' /><a href='#f1407' class='c012'><sup>[1407]</sup></a> Those trees
which it was customary to renew by seed were the
pistachio, the filbert, the almond, the chestnut, the
white peach, the damascene, the pine-tree, and the
edible pine, the palm, the cypress, the laurel, the
ash, the maple, and the fig. The apple,<a id='r1408' /><a href='#f1408' class='c012'><sup>[1408]</sup></a> the cherry,
the rhamnus jujuba, the common nut, the dwarf
laurel, the myrtle, and the medlar, were propagated
by suckers; while the quicker and surer mode of
raising trees from boughs was frequently adopted
in the case of the almond, the pear, the mulberry,
the citron,<a id='r1409' /><a href='#f1409' class='c012'><sup>[1409]</sup></a> the apple, the olive, the quince,<a id='r1410' /><a href='#f1410' class='c012'><sup>[1410]</sup></a> the
black and white poplar, the ivy, the jujube-tree,
the myrtle, the chestnut, the vine, the willow, the
box, and the cytisus.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the thrifty people of Hellas seldom devoted
the orchard-ground entirely to fruit-trees. The custom
seems to have been to lay out the whole in
beds and borders for the cultivation of vegetables,
and to plant trees, at intervals, along the edges and
at the corners. These beds, moreover, were often,
as with us, edged with parsley and rue; whence the
proverb,—“You have not proceeded beyond the rue,”
for “You know nothing of the matter.”<a id='r1411' /><a href='#f1411' class='c012'><sup>[1411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>The rustics of antiquity, who put generally great
faith in spells and talismans, possessed an extraordinary
charm for ensuring unfailing fertility to their
gardens; they buried an ass’s head deep in the middle
of them, and sprinkled the ground with the juice
of fenugreek and lotus.<a id='r1412' /><a href='#f1412' class='c012'><sup>[1412]</sup></a> Somewhat greater efficacy,
however, may be attributed to their laborious methods
of manuring and irrigation.<a id='r1413' /><a href='#f1413' class='c012'><sup>[1413]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The aspect of such a garden differed very little,
except perhaps in luxuriance, from a similar plot of
ground in Kent or Middlesex. Here you perceived
beds of turnips, or cabbages, or onions; there, lettuces,
or endive, or succory,<a id='r1414' /><a href='#f1414' class='c012'><sup>[1414]</sup></a> in the process of blanching,
or the delicate heads of asparagus, or broad-beans,
or lentils, or peas, or kidney-beans, or artichokes.
In the most sunny spots were ranges of
boxes or baskets for forcing cucumbers.<a id='r1415' /><a href='#f1415' class='c012'><sup>[1415]</sup></a> Near the
brooks, where such existed, were patches of watermelons,<a id='r1416' /><a href='#f1416' class='c012'><sup>[1416]</sup></a>
the finest in the world; and here and there,
clasping round the trunks of trees,<a id='r1417' /><a href='#f1417' class='c012'><sup>[1417]</sup></a> and, suspending
its huge leaves and spheres from among the branches,
you might behold the gourd,<a id='r1418' /><a href='#f1418' class='c012'><sup>[1418]</sup></a> as I have often seen
it in the palm-groves of Nubia. It may be added,
that the pumpkin, or common gourd, was eaten by
the Greeks,<a id='r1419' /><a href='#f1419' class='c012'><sup>[1419]</sup></a> as it is still in France and Asia Minor.<a id='r1420' /><a href='#f1420' class='c012'><sup>[1420]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Lettuces<a id='r1421' /><a href='#f1421' class='c012'><sup>[1421]</sup></a> were blanched by being tied a-top, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>being buried up to a certain point in sand.<a id='r1422' /><a href='#f1422' class='c012'><sup>[1422]</sup></a> They
were, moreover, supposed to be rendered more rich
and delicate by being watered with a mixture of
wine and honey, as was the practice of the gourmand
Aristoxenos, who having done so over-night, used
next morning to cut them, and say they were so
many green cakes sent him by mother Earth.<a id='r1423' /><a href='#f1423' class='c012'><sup>[1423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Greek gardeners appear to have delighted
exceedingly in the production of monstrous vegetables.
Thus, in the case of the cucumber, their principal
object appears to have been to produce it without
seed, or of some extraordinary shape.<a id='r1424' /><a href='#f1424' class='c012'><sup>[1424]</sup></a> In the first
case they diligently watched the appearance of the
plant above ground, and then covering it over with
fresh earth, and repeating the same operation three
times, the cucumbers it bore were found to be seedless.
The same effect was produced by steeping the
seeds in sesamum-oil for three days before they were
sown. They were made to grow to a great length
by having vessels of water<a id='r1425' /><a href='#f1425' class='c012'><sup>[1425]</sup></a> placed daily within a
few inches of their points, which, exciting by attraction
a sort of nisus in the fruit, drew them forward
as far as the gardener thought necessary.<a id='r1426' /><a href='#f1426' class='c012'><sup>[1426]</sup></a> They
were made, likewise, to assume all sorts of forms by
the use of light, fictile moulds,<a id='r1427' /><a href='#f1427' class='c012'><sup>[1427]</sup></a> as in the case of
the citron. Another method was, to take a large
reed,<a id='r1428' /><a href='#f1428' class='c012'><sup>[1428]</sup></a> split it, and clear out the pith; then introducing
the young cucumber into the hollow, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>sections of the reed were bound together, and the
fruit projected itself through the tube until it acquired
an enormous length. It is observed by Theophrastus,
that if you steep the seeds of cucumbers
in milk, or an infusion of honey, it will improve
their flavour.<a id='r1429' /><a href='#f1429' class='c012'><sup>[1429]</sup></a> They were, moreover, believed to expand
in size at the full of the moon, like the sea-hedgehog.<a id='r1430' /><a href='#f1430' class='c012'><sup>[1430]</sup></a>
A fragrant smell was supposed to be
communicated to melons<a id='r1431' /><a href='#f1431' class='c012'><sup>[1431]</sup></a> by constantly keeping the
seed in dry rose-leaves. To preserve the seed for
any length of time, it was sprinkled with the juice
of house-leek.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Megaréans, in whose country melons, gourds,<a id='r1432' /><a href='#f1432' class='c012'><sup>[1432]</sup></a>
and cucumbers were plentiful, were accustomed to
heap dust about their roots during the prevalence of
the Etesian winds, and found this answer <a id='corr328.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='of of'>of</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_328.16'><ins class='correction' title='of of'>of</ins></a></span>
irrigation.<a id='r1433' /><a href='#f1433' class='c012'><sup>[1433]</sup></a> It appears from the following proverb,—“The
end of cucumbers and the beginning of pompions,”—that
the former went out of season as the
latter came in.<a id='r1434' /><a href='#f1434' class='c012'><sup>[1434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To procure a plentiful crop of asparagus, they used
to bury the shavings of a wild ram’s horn, and well
water them.<a id='r1435' /><a href='#f1435' class='c012'><sup>[1435]</sup></a> By banking up the stalks, moreover,
immediately after cutting the heads, they caused new
shoots to spring forth, and thus enjoyed a fresh supply
throughout the year. This plant was probably
obtained from Libya,<a id='r1436' /><a href='#f1436' class='c012'><sup>[1436]</sup></a> where it was said to attain,
in its wild state, the height of twelve, and sometimes
even of thirty cubits;<a id='r1437' /><a href='#f1437' class='c012'><sup>[1437]</sup></a> and on the slopes of Lebanon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>in Syria, it has in our own clay been seen from twelve
to fifteen feet high.</p>

<p class='c001'>That kind of cabbage which we call savoys was
supposed to flourish best in saline spots, on which
account the gardeners used to sift pounded nitre<a id='r1438' /><a href='#f1438' class='c012'><sup>[1438]</sup></a>
over the beds where it was sown, as was the practice
also in Egypt. In and about Alexandria,<a id='r1439' /><a href='#f1439' class='c012'><sup>[1439]</sup></a> however,
there was said to be some peculiar quality in
the earth which communicated a bitter taste to the
cabbage. To prevent this they imported cabbage-seed
from the island of Rhodes, which produced good
plants the first year, but experienced in the second
the acrid influence of the soil.<a id='r1440' /><a href='#f1440' class='c012'><sup>[1440]</sup></a> Kumè was celebrated
for its fine cabbages, which, when full-grown,
were of a yellowish green colour, like the new leather
sole of a sandal. Broccoli and sea-kale and cauliflowers
would appear to have been commonly cultivated
in the gardens of the ancients. There was,
likewise, among them a sort of cabbage supposed to
have some connexion with the gift of prophecy;<a id='r1441' /><a href='#f1441' class='c012'><sup>[1441]</sup></a>
and by this, probably, it was, that certain comic
personages used to swear, as Socrates by the dog,
and Zeno by the caper-bush.</p>

<p class='c001'>Radishes<a id='r1442' /><a href='#f1442' class='c012'><sup>[1442]</sup></a> were rendered sweet by steeping the
seeds in wine and honey, or the fresh juice of grapes:
Nicander speaks of preserved turnips.<a id='r1443' /><a href='#f1443' class='c012'><sup>[1443]</sup></a> Parsley-seed
was put into the earth in an old rag, or a wisp of
straw,<a id='r1444' /><a href='#f1444' class='c012'><sup>[1444]</sup></a> surrounded with manure, and well-watered,
which made the plant grow large. Rue they sowed in
warm and sunny spots, without manure.<a id='r1445' /><a href='#f1445' class='c012'><sup>[1445]</sup></a> It was defended
from the cold of winter by being surrounded
with heaps of ashes,<a id='r1446' /><a href='#f1446' class='c012'><sup>[1446]</sup></a> and was sometimes planted in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>pots, probably to be kept in apartments for the sake
of its bright yellow flowers,<a id='r1447' /><a href='#f1447' class='c012'><sup>[1447]</sup></a> and because, when smelt,
it was said to cure the head-ache. The juice of wild
rue, mixed with woman’s milk, sharpened the sight,
in the opinion of the ancients.<a id='r1448' /><a href='#f1448' class='c012'><sup>[1448]</sup></a> The juice of sweet
mint, which was a garden herb, squeezed into milk,<a id='r1449' /><a href='#f1449' class='c012'><sup>[1449]</sup></a>
was supposed to prevent coagulation, even should
rennet be afterwards thrown into it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both the root and bean of the nymphæa nelumbo
or red lotus,<a id='r1450' /><a href='#f1450' class='c012'><sup>[1450]</sup></a> were eaten in Egypt,<a id='r1451' /><a href='#f1451' class='c012'><sup>[1451]</sup></a> where its crimson
flowers were woven into crowns which diffused
an agreeable odour, and were considered exceedingly
refreshing in the heat of summer.<a id='r1452' /><a href='#f1452' class='c012'><sup>[1452]</sup></a> This plant was
by the Greeks of Naucratis denominated the melilotus,
to distinguish it from the lotus with white
flowers. Theophrastus<a id='r1453' /><a href='#f1453' class='c012'><sup>[1453]</sup></a> observes, that it grows in the
marshes to the height of four cubits, and has a
striped root and stem. This lotus was also anciently
found in Syria and Cilicia, but did not there
ripen. In the environs of Toronè in Chalcidice,<a id='r1454' /><a href='#f1454' class='c012'><sup>[1454]</sup></a>
however, it was found in perfection in a small marsh.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lupin,<a id='r1455' /><a href='#f1455' class='c012'><sup>[1455]</sup></a> and the caper-bush, probably cultivated
for the beauty of its delicate white flowers,<a id='r1456' /><a href='#f1456' class='c012'><sup>[1456]</sup></a> deteriorated
in gardens,<a id='r1457' /><a href='#f1457' class='c012'><sup>[1457]</sup></a> as did likewise the mallows,<a id='r1458' /><a href='#f1458' class='c012'><sup>[1458]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>which, together with the beet, were said to acquire
in gardens the height of a small tree.<a id='r1459' /><a href='#f1459' class='c012'><sup>[1459]</sup></a> The stem

the dittander, or pepperwort, turnips,<a id='r1467' /><a href='#f1467' class='c012'><sup>[1467]</sup></a> and

and leeks.<a id='r1469' /><a href='#f1469' class='c012'><sup>[1469]</sup></a> For these last Megara was famous,
as Attica was for honey, which suggested to the
Athenians an occasion of compliment to themselves,<a id='r1470' /><a href='#f1470' class='c012'><sup>[1470]</sup></a>
it having been a saying among them, that they were
as superior to the Megareans as honey is to garlic
and leeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cultivation of that species of leek called gethyllis
was carried to great perfection at Delphi,<a id='r1471' /><a href='#f1471' class='c012'><sup>[1471]</sup></a>
where it was an established custom, evidently with
a view to the improvement of gardening, that the
person who, on the day of the Theoxenia,<a id='r1472' /><a href='#f1472' class='c012'><sup>[1472]</sup></a> presented
the largest vegetable of this kind to Leto should
receive a portion from the holy table.<a id='r1473' /><a href='#f1473' class='c012'><sup>[1473]</sup></a> Polemo, who
relates this circumstance says, that he had seen on
these occasions leeks nearly as large as turnips. The
cause of this ceremony was said to be, that Leto
when great with Apollo longed for a leek.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mushrooms<a id='r1474' /><a href='#f1474' class='c012'><sup>[1474]</sup></a> were sedulously cultivated by the ancients,
among whose methods of producing them
were the following. They felled a poplar-tree<a id='r1475' /><a href='#f1475' class='c012'><sup>[1475]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>laying its trunk in the earth to rot, watered it assiduously,
after which mushrooms, at the proper time
sprung up. Another method was to irrigate the
trunk of the fig-tree after having covered it all round
with dung, though the best kind in the opinion of
others were such as grew at the foot of elm and pine-trees.<a id='r1476' /><a href='#f1476' class='c012'><sup>[1476]</sup></a>
Those springing from the upper roots were
reckoned of no value.</p>

<p class='c001'>On other occasions<a id='r1477' /><a href='#f1477' class='c012'><sup>[1477]</sup></a> they chose a light sandy soil
accustomed to produce reeds, then burning brushwood,
&amp;c., when the air was in a state indicating
rain, this ambiguous species of vegetable started
forth from the earth with the first shower. The
same effect was produced by watering the ground
thus prepared, though this species was supposed to
be inferior. In France, the most delicate sort of
mushrooms are said to proceed from the decayed
root of the Eryngium.</p>

<p class='c001'>This vegetable appears to have been a favourite
dish among the ancients, together with the truffle,<a id='r1478' /><a href='#f1478' class='c012'><sup>[1478]</sup></a>
eaten both cooked and raw;<a id='r1479' /><a href='#f1479' class='c012'><sup>[1479]</sup></a> and the morrille.<a id='r1480' /><a href='#f1480' class='c012'><sup>[1480]</sup></a>
That particular kind, called geranion, is the modern
crane’s bill. The Misu, another sort of truffle,<a id='r1481' /><a href='#f1481' class='c012'><sup>[1481]</sup></a>
grew chiefly in the sandy plains about Cyrene, and,
as well as the Iton,<a id='r1482' /><a href='#f1482' class='c012'><sup>[1482]</sup></a> found in the lofty downs of
Thrace, was said to exhale an agreeable odour resembling
that of animal food. These fanciful luxuries,
which were produced among the rains and
thunders<a id='r1483' /><a href='#f1483' class='c012'><sup>[1483]</sup></a> of autumn, continued to flourish in the
earth during a whole year, but were thought to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>in season in spring. Truffle-seed was usually imported
from Megara, Lycia, and Getulia; but in
Mytelene the inhabitants were spared this expense,
their sandy shores being annually sown from the
neighbouring coast by the winds and showers. It
has been remarked, that neither truffles nor wild
onions were found near the Hellespont.<a id='r1484' /><a href='#f1484' class='c012'><sup>[1484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>What methods the ancients employed for discovering
the truffle, which grows without stem or leaf
in a small cell beneath the surface of the earth, I
have nowhere seen explained. At present<a id='r1485' /><a href='#f1485' class='c012'><sup>[1485]</sup></a> their
existence is said to be detected in Greece, not by
the truffle hound, but by the divining rod. On the
dry sandy downs of the Limousin, Gascogne, Angoumois,
and Perigord, as well as in several parts
of Italy,<a id='r1486' /><a href='#f1486' class='c012'><sup>[1486]</sup></a> they are collected by the swineherds;
for the hogs being extremely fond of them utter
grunts of joy, and begin to turn up the earth as
soon as they scent their odour, upon which the
herdsmen beat the animals away, and carefully preserve
the delicacy for the tables of the rich. At
other times they are discovered in the following
manner: the herdsmen stooping down, and looking
horizontally along the surface of the Landes, observe
here and there, on spots bare of grass and
full of fissures, clouds of very diminutive flies hatched
in the truffle, and still regaling themselves with
its perfume. In some parts of Savoy they have
been found two pounds in weight.</p>

has captivated the imagination of
all succeeding writers, many of
whom have sought to express
their admiration by imitating it
in their own style:—Ἥ τε γὰρ

this passage is thus expressed by
Cicero: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cur non imitamur Socratem

<p class='c001'>Pliny has a curious passage on
the use of crowns among the Romans,
which Holland has thus
translated: “Now when these
garlands of flowers were taken
up and received commonly in all
places for a certain time, there
came soon after into request
those chaplets which are named
Egyptian; and after them,
winter coronets, to wit, when
the earth affordeth no flowers
to make them, and these consisted
of horn shavings dyed
into sundry colours. And so
in process of time, by little and
little crept into Rome, also the
name of corolla, or as one would
say, petty garlands; for that
these winter chaplets at first
were so pretty and small: and
not long after them, the costly
coronets and others, corollaries,
namely, when they are
made of thin leaves and plates
and latten, either gilded or silvered
over, or else set out with
golden and silvered spangles,
and so presented.” xxi. 2. Pollux
affords a list of the principal
flowers used in crowns by the
Greeks: τὰ δὲ ἐν τοῖς στεφάνοις
ἄνθη, ῥόδα, ἴα, κρίνα, σισύμθρια,
ἀνεμῶναι, ἕρπυλος, κρόκος, ὑάκινθος,
ἑλίχρυσος, ἡμεροκαλὲς, ἑλένειον,

καὶ τἄλλα ὅσα τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς

The same naturalist speaks of
two plane trees, the one at Delphi,
the other at Caphyæ in Arcadia,
said to have been planted
by the hand of Agamemnon,
which were still flourishing in
his own days, iv. 13. 2. This
tree attains a prodigious size in
Peloponnesos. Chandler, Travels,
ii. 308. Our traveller was
prevented from measuring the
stem by the fear of certain Albanian
soldiers who lay asleep under
it; but Theophrastus gives
us the dimensions of a large platane,
at Antandros, whose trunk,
he says, could scarcely be embraced
by four men, while its
height before the springing forth
of the boughs was fifteen feet.
Having described the dimensions
of the tree, he relates a very extraordinary
fact in natural history,
namely, that this platane,
having been blown down by the
winds and lightened of its branches
by the axe, rose again spontaneously
during the night, put forth
fresh boughs, and flourished as
before. The same thing is related
of a white poplar in the
museum at Stagira, and of a large
willow at Philippi. In this last
city a soothsayer counselled the
inhabitants to offer sacrifice, and
set a guard about the tree, as a
thing of auspicious omen. Theoph.
Hist. Plant. iv. 16. 2, seq.
Cf. Plin. xvi. 57. In corroboration
of the narrative of Theophrastus,
Palmerius relates, that,
during the winter of 1624–25,
while Breda was besieged by
Ambrosio Spinola, he himself
saw in Brabant an oak twenty-five
feet high, and three feet in
circumference, overthrown by the
wind, and recovering itself exactly
in the manner described by
the great naturalist. The vulgar,
who regarded it as a miracle,
preserved portions of its
bark or branches as amulets.—Excercitationes,

Cardan in his treatise De Subtilitate
having undertaken to assign
the cause why certain flowers
bend towards the sun, his antagonist,
J. C. Scaliger, remarks upon
his philosophy as follows:—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De
floribus, qui ad Solem convertuntur
non pessime ais: tenue
humidum ad Solis calorem, se habere,
ut corii ad ignem. Cæterum
adhuc integra restat quæstio.
Rosis enim tenuissimum esse humidum
testantur omnia. Non
convertuntur tamen. Platonici
flores quosdam etiam Lunæ dicunt
esse familiares: qui sane
huic Sideri, sicut illi suo canant
hymnos, sed mortalibus ignotos
auribus.”</span> Exercit. 170, § 2.
“The cause (of the bowing of the
heliotrope) is somewhat obscure;
but I take it to be no other, but
that the part against which the
sun heateth, waxeth more faint
and flaccid in the stalk, and
thereby less able to support the
flower.” Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER III. <br /> VINEYARD, VINTAGE, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One of the principal branches of husbandry<a id='r1487' /><a href='#f1487' class='c012'><sup>[1487]</sup></a> in
Greece was the culture of the vine, probably introduced
from Phœnicia.<a id='r1488' /><a href='#f1488' class='c012'><sup>[1488]</sup></a> Long before the historical
age, however, it had spread itself through the whole
country, together with several parts of Asia Minor,
as may be inferred from the language of Homer,<a id='r1489' /><a href='#f1489' class='c012'><sup>[1489]</sup></a>
who frequently enumerates vineyards among the
possessions of his heroes. Like most things the
origin of which was unknown, the vine furnished
the poets and common people with the subjects of
numerous fables, some of which were reckoned of
sufficient importance to be treasured up and transmitted
to posterity. Thus, among the Ozolian Locrians,
it was said<a id='r1490' /><a href='#f1490' class='c012'><sup>[1490]</sup></a> to have sprung from a small
piece of wood, brought forth in lieu of whelps by
a bitch. Others supposed a spot near Olympia<a id='r1491' /><a href='#f1491' class='c012'><sup>[1491]</sup></a> to
have given birth to the vine, in proof of which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>inhabitants affirmed a miracle was wrought annually
among them during the Dionysiac festival. They
took three empty brazen vessels, and having closely
covered and sealed them in the presence of witnesses,
again opened them after some interval of
time, not stated, when they were found full of
wine. According to other authorities, the environs
of Plinthinè, in Egypt, had the honour of being
the cradle of Dionysos, on which account the ancient
Egyptians were by some accused of inebriety,
though in the age of Herodotus<a id='r1492' /><a href='#f1492' class='c012'><sup>[1492]</sup></a> there would appear
to have been no vineyards in the whole valley
of the Nile. In reality,<a id='r1493' /><a href='#f1493' class='c012'><sup>[1493]</sup></a> the vine appears to be a
native of all temperate climates, both in the old
world and the new, and will even flourish<a id='r1494' /><a href='#f1494' class='c012'><sup>[1494]</sup></a> and produce
fine grapes in various situations within the
tropics, where clusters in different stages of ripeness
may be observed upon its branches at all seasons
of the year.</p>

<p class='c001'>The opinions of Grecian writers respecting the
soil best suited to the cultivation of the vine, having
been founded on experience, generally agree
with those which prevail in modern times.<a id='r1495' /><a href='#f1495' class='c012'><sup>[1495]</sup></a> They
preferred for their vineyards the gentle acclivities
of hills,<a id='r1496' /><a href='#f1496' class='c012'><sup>[1496]</sup></a> where the soil was good, though light and
porous, and abounding in springs at no great depth
from the surface.<a id='r1497' /><a href='#f1497' class='c012'><sup>[1497]</sup></a> A considerable degree of moisture
was always supposed to be indispensable, on
which account, in arid situations, large hollow sea-shells,
and fragments of sandstone<a id='r1498' /><a href='#f1498' class='c012'><sup>[1498]</sup></a> were buried in
the soil, these being regarded as so many reservoirs
of humidity.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>By some the vine was even thought to delight in
the rich alluvial soil of plains, such as is found in
Egypt,<a id='r1499' /><a href='#f1499' class='c012'><sup>[1499]</sup></a> where, in later times, the banks of the Nile,
from Elephantinè to the sea, seem to have presented
one vast succession of vineyards.<a id='r1500' /><a href='#f1500' class='c012'><sup>[1500]</sup></a> But superior
vines were produced on a few spots only, as at
Koptos, and in the neighbourhood of Lake Mareotis,
where showers of sand, pouring in from the desert
or the sea-shore, diminished the fatness of the
ground. With respect to Koptos, we possess, however,
no precise information,<a id='r1501' /><a href='#f1501' class='c012'><sup>[1501]</sup></a> but are expressly told,
that the Mareotic vineyards covered a series of sandy
swells, stretching eastward from the lake towards
Rosetta.<a id='r1502' /><a href='#f1502' class='c012'><sup>[1502]</sup></a> On the southern confines of Egypt, in
the rocky and picturesque island of Elephantinè, the
vine was said<a id='r1503' /><a href='#f1503' class='c012'><sup>[1503]</sup></a> never to shed its leaves; but as none
grow there at present, the traveller has no opportunity
of deciding this question. In Greece the vineyards
of the plains were generally appropriated to
the production of the green grape, the purple being
supposed to prefer the sides of hills, or even of
mountains, provided it were not exposed to the
furious winds upon their summits. Several sorts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>white grape, also, as the Psillian, Corcyrean, and
the Chlorian, delighted in elevated vineyards,<a id='r1504' /><a href='#f1504' class='c012'><sup>[1504]</sup></a> though
it was often judged necessary to reverse these rules,
and compel the hill-nurslings to descend to the plains,
while those of the plains were in their turn exposed
to the climate of the mountains.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much judgment was thought to be required in
selecting the site of a vineyard, though almost everything
depended on the climate and general configuration
of the district in which it was situated. Thus
in warm countries, as in the Pentapolis of Cyrene,
the vineyards sloped towards the north; in Laconia,
they occupied the eastern face of Mount Taygetos,
while in Attica and the islands, the hills often appear
to have been encircled with vines. Upon the
whole, however, those were most esteemed which
looked towards the rising sun and enjoyed, without
obstruction, the first rays of the morning.<a id='r1505' /><a href='#f1505' class='c012'><sup>[1505]</sup></a> And
this also is the case in the Côte d’Or, where the
best wines, as the Chambertin, the Vin de Beaune,
and that of the Clos Vougeot, are grown on eastern
declivities. In some parts of Greece, the vine was
strongly affected by the prevalence of certain winds,
as those of the east and the west in Thessaly, which in
the forty cold days of winter were attended by frost
that killed its upper extremities, and sometimes the
whole trunk. At Chalcis, in Eubœa likewise, the
Olympias, a western wind, parched and shrivelled,
or, as the Greeks express it, burnt up the leaves,
sometimes completely destroying the shrub itself.<a id='r1506' /><a href='#f1506' class='c012'><sup>[1506]</sup></a>
In such situations it was accordingly found necessary
to protect it by a covering<a id='r1507' /><a href='#f1507' class='c012'><sup>[1507]</sup></a> during the prevalence
of cold winds. At Methana, in Argolis, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>the south-east in spring blew up the Saronic gulf,<a id='r1508' /><a href='#f1508' class='c012'><sup>[1508]</sup></a>
the inhabitants, to defend them from it, spread over
their vines the invisible teguments of a spell; which
was effected in the following manner: taking a milk-white
cock, and cutting it in halves, two men seized
each a part, and then, standing back to back, started
off in opposite directions, made the tour of the vineyard,
and, returning whence they had set out, buried
the cock’s remains in the earth. After this the Libs
might blow as it listed, since it possessed no power
to injure any man’s property within the consecrated
circle.<a id='r1509' /><a href='#f1509' class='c012'><sup>[1509]</sup></a> The prevalence of the north wind during
autumn was considered auspicious, as they supposed
it to hasten the ripening of the fruit.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the husbandman had resolved on the formation
of a new vineyard, he first, of course, encircled
the spot with a hedge<a id='r1510' /><a href='#f1510' class='c012'><sup>[1510]</sup></a> which was made both
thick and strong for the purpose of repelling the
flocks and herds, which, as well as goats, foxes, and
soldiers, loved to prey upon the vine.<a id='r1511' /><a href='#f1511' class='c012'><sup>[1511]</sup></a> His next
care was to root up the hazel bush and the oleaster,
the roots of the former being supposed to be
inimical to the Dionysiac tree, while the oily bark
of the latter rendered it peculiarly susceptible of
taking fire, by which means vineyards would often
appear to have been reduced to ashes. So at least
says Virgil.<a id='r1512' /><a href='#f1512' class='c012'><sup>[1512]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The next operation<a id='r1513' /><a href='#f1513' class='c012'><sup>[1513]</sup></a> was to trench the ground and
throw it into lofty ridges, which, by the operation
of the summer sun, and the rain and winds and
frosts of winter, were rendered mellow and genial.
Occasionally a species of manure, composed<a id='r1514' /><a href='#f1514' class='c012'><sup>[1514]</sup></a> of pounded
acorns, lentils, and other vegetable substances,
was dug in for the purpose of giving to the soil
the warmth and fertility required by the vine.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ground having remained in this state during
a whole year, its surface was levelled, and a series
of shallow furrows traced for the slips by line, rather
close, on rich alluvial plains, but diverging
more and more<a id='r1515' /><a href='#f1515' class='c012'><sup>[1515]</sup></a> in proportion to the elevation of
the site. Generally the vine was propagated by
slips of moderate length, planted sometimes upright
or à l’aiguille,<a id='r1516' /><a href='#f1516' class='c012'><sup>[1516]</sup></a> as the phrase is in Languedoc, sometimes
obliquely,<a id='r1517' /><a href='#f1517' class='c012'><sup>[1517]</sup></a> which was generally supposed to
be the better fashion. Along with the slip a handfull
of grape-stones was usually cast into the furrow,<a id='r1518' /><a href='#f1518' class='c012'><sup>[1518]</sup></a>
those of the green grape with the purple vine,
and those of the purple with the green, in order
to cause it the sooner to take root. With some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the practice was always to set two slips together, so
that if one missed the other might take, and when
both grew, the weaker was cut off or removed.
Several stones,<a id='r1519' /><a href='#f1519' class='c012'><sup>[1519]</sup></a> about the size of the fist, were
placed round the slip above whatever manure was
used, the belief being, that they would aid in preventing
the root from being scorched by the sun
in the heats of summer.<a id='r1520' /><a href='#f1520' class='c012'><sup>[1520]</sup></a> Some touched the lower
point of the slip with cedar oil which prevented it
from decaying, and likewise by its odour repelled
vermin.</p>

<p class='c001'>To produce grapes without stones the lower end
of the slip was split, and the pith carefully extracted
with an ear-pick.<a id='r1521' /><a href='#f1521' class='c012'><sup>[1521]</sup></a> It was then bound round
with a papyrus leaf, thrust into a sea-onion and
thus planted. Vines producing medicinal grapes
were created by withdrawing the pith from the
lower part of the slip, but without splitting, and
introducing certain drugs into the hollow,<a id='r1522' /><a href='#f1522' class='c012'><sup>[1522]</sup></a> closing
up the extremity with papyrus and thus setting it
in the earth. The wine, the grape, the leaves, and
even the ashes of such a vine were thought to be
a remedy against the bite of serpents and dogs,
though no security against hydrophobia. Another
mode of producing stoneless grapes was to cut short
all the branches of a vine already growing, extract
the pith from the ends of them, and fill up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>cavity once a-week with the juice of sylphion,<a id='r1523' /><a href='#f1523' class='c012'><sup>[1523]</sup></a> binding
them carefully to props that the liquor might
not escape. A method was also in use of producing
green and purple grapes on the same cluster.<a id='r1524' /><a href='#f1524' class='c012'><sup>[1524]</sup></a> This
was to take two slips as nearly as possible of the
same size, the one of the white, the other of the
black grape, and, having split them down the middle,
carefully to fit the halves to their opposites,
so that the buds, when divided, should exactly
meet. They were then bound tight together with
papyrus thread, and placed in the earth in a sea-onion,<a id='r1525' /><a href='#f1525' class='c012'><sup>[1525]</sup></a>
whose glutinous juice aided the growing together
of the severed parts. Sometimes instead of
slips, offshoots removed from the trunk of a large
vine, with roots attached to them, were used. On
other occasions the vine was grafted, like any other
fruit-tree, on a variety of stocks,<a id='r1526' /><a href='#f1526' class='c012'><sup>[1526]</sup></a> each modifying
the quality and flavour of the grape. Thus a vine
grafted on a myrtle-stock,<a id='r1527' /><a href='#f1527' class='c012'><sup>[1527]</sup></a> produced fruit partaking
of the character of the myrtle-berry. Grafted on a
cherry-tree, its grapes underwent a different change,
and ripened, like cherries, in the spring. As the
clay encircling the junctures of these grafts grew dry,
and somewhat cracked in hot summers, it was customary
for gardeners to moisten them every evening
with a sponge dipped in water.<a id='r1528' /><a href='#f1528' class='c012'><sup>[1528]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The husbandmen of antiquity were often somewhat
fanciful in their practices. In order, when forming
a nursery,<a id='r1529' /><a href='#f1529' class='c012'><sup>[1529]</sup></a> to coax the young plants to grow, the
beds to which they were transferred, were formed
of a stratum of earth brought from the vineyard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>whence they also were taken. Another nicety was
to take care, that they occupied precisely the same
position with respect to the quarters of the heavens<a id='r1530' /><a href='#f1530' class='c012'><sup>[1530]</sup></a>
as when growing on the parent stock.<a id='r1531' /><a href='#f1531' class='c012'><sup>[1531]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Besides to plant it as it was they mark</div>
      <div class='line'>The heaven’s four quarters on the tender bark,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the north or south restore the side</div>
      <div class='line'>Which at their birth did heat or cold abide,</div>
      <div class='line'>So strong is custom; such effects can use</div>
      <div class='line'>In tender souls of pliant plants produce.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When desirous of extending the plantation in an
old vineyard, instead of the methods above described,
they had recourse to another, which was to bend
down<a id='r1532' /><a href='#f1532' class='c012'><sup>[1532]</sup></a> the vine branch, and bury it up to the point
in the earth, where it would take root, and send forth
a new vine, and in this way a long series of leafy
arcades<a id='r1533' /><a href='#f1533' class='c012'><sup>[1533]</sup></a> may sometimes have been formed. At the
foot of their vines some cultivators were in the habit
of burying three goats’ horns<a id='r1534' /><a href='#f1534' class='c012'><sup>[1534]</sup></a> with their points downwards,
and the other end appearing above the soil.
These they regarded as so many receptacles for receiving
and gradually conveying water to the roots,
and, consequently, an active cause of the vines’ fertility.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Respecting the seasons of planting,<a id='r1535' /><a href='#f1535' class='c012'><sup>[1535]</sup></a> opinions were
divided, some preferring the close of autumn, immediately
after the fall of the leaf, when the sap
had forsaken the branches, and descended to the
roots; others chose, for the time of this operation,
the early spring, just before the sap mounted; while
a third class delayed it until the buds began to swell,
and the tokens of spring were evident. To these
varieties of practice Virgil makes allusion,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When winter frosts constrain the field with cold,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fainty root can take no steady hold;</div>
      <div class='line'>But when the golden spring reveals the year,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the white bird returns whom serpents fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That season deem the best to plant thy vines;</div>
      <div class='line'>Next that, is when autumnal warmth declines,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere heat is quite decayed, or cold begun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Capricorn admits the winter sun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But the above were not the only rules observed;
for, besides the general march of the seasons, they took
note of the phases of the moon,<a id='r1536' /><a href='#f1536' class='c012'><sup>[1536]</sup></a> whose influence
over vegetation all antiquity believed to be very
powerful. Some planted during the four days immediately
succeeding the birth of the new moon, while
others extended their labours through the first two
quarters. The act of pruning<a id='r1537' /><a href='#f1537' class='c012'><sup>[1537]</sup></a> was performed when
that planet was in its wane.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were in Greece<a id='r1538' /><a href='#f1538' class='c012'><sup>[1538]</sup></a> three remarkable varieties
of the vine, created by difference in the mode of
cultivation.<a id='r1539' /><a href='#f1539' class='c012'><sup>[1539]</sup></a> The first consisted of plants always
kept short, and supported on props, as in France;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the second of tree-climbers, thence called Anadendrades;
the third sort enjoyed neither of these advantages,<a id='r1540' /><a href='#f1540' class='c012'><sup>[1540]</sup></a>
but being grown chiefly in steep and stony
places, spread their branches over the earth, as is still
the fashion in Syra<a id='r1541' /><a href='#f1541' class='c012'><sup>[1541]</sup></a> and other islands of the Archipelago.</p>

<p class='c001'>Vine-props<a id='r1542' /><a href='#f1542' class='c012'><sup>[1542]</sup></a> appear to have commonly consisted of
short reeds, which, accordingly, were extensively cultivated
both in Hellas and its colonies of Northern
Africa, where the musical cicada, whose excessive
multiplication betokened a sickly year, bored through
the rind, and laid its eggs in the hollow within.<a id='r1543' /><a href='#f1543' class='c012'><sup>[1543]</sup></a>
From an inconvenience attending the use of this kind
of support came the rustic proverb, “The prop has
defrauded the vine;”<a id='r1544' /><a href='#f1544' class='c012'><sup>[1544]</sup></a> for these reeds sometimes took
root, outgrew their clients, and monopolized the moisture
of the soil.</p>

<p class='c001'>In rich and level lands,<a id='r1545' /><a href='#f1545' class='c012'><sup>[1545]</sup></a> particularly where the
Aminian vine<a id='r1546' /><a href='#f1546' class='c012'><sup>[1546]</sup></a> was cultivated, the props often rose
to the height of five or six feet; but in hill-vineyards,
where the soil was lighter and less nutritive,
they were not suffered to exceed that of three feet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Where reeds were not procurable, ash-props<a id='r1547' /><a href='#f1547' class='c012'><sup>[1547]</sup></a> were
substituted, but they were always carefully barked,
to prevent cantharides, and other insects hurtful to
the vine, from making nests in them. Their price
would appear to have been considerable, since we
find a husbandman speaking of having laid out a
hundred drachma in vine-props.<a id='r1548' /><a href='#f1548' class='c012'><sup>[1548]</sup></a> To prevent their
speedily decaying they were smeared a-top with pitch,
and carefully, after the vintage, collected and laid
up within doors.<a id='r1549' /><a href='#f1549' class='c012'><sup>[1549]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A vineyard, consisting wholly of Anadendrades,<a id='r1550' /><a href='#f1550' class='c012'><sup>[1550]</sup></a>
most common in Attica, presented, in spring and
summer, a very picturesque appearance, especially
when situated on the sharp declivity of a hill.<a id='r1551' /><a href='#f1551' class='c012'><sup>[1551]</sup></a> The
trees designed for the support of the vines,<a id='r1552' /><a href='#f1552' class='c012'><sup>[1552]</sup></a> planted
in straight lines, and rising behind each other, terrace
above terrace, at intervals of three or four and twenty
feet, were beautiful in form and varied in feature,
consisting generally of the black poplar, the ash,
the maple, the elm,<a id='r1553' /><a href='#f1553' class='c012'><sup>[1553]</sup></a> and probably, also, the platane,
which is still employed for this purpose in Crete.<a id='r1554' /><a href='#f1554' class='c012'><sup>[1554]</sup></a>
Though kept low in some situations, where the soil
was scanty, they were, in others, allowed to run to
thirty or forty, and sometimes, as in Bithynia, even
to sixty feet in height.</p>

<p class='c001'>The face of the tree along which the vine climbed
was cut down sheer like a wall, against which the
purple or golden clusters hung thickly suspended,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>while the young branches crept along the boughs,
or over bridges of reeds,<a id='r1555' /><a href='#f1555' class='c012'><sup>[1555]</sup></a> uniting tree with tree,
and, when touched with the rich tints of autumn,
delighting the eye by an extraordinary variety of
foliage. As the lower boughs of these noble trees
were carefully lopped away, a series of lofty arches
was created, beneath which the breezes could freely
play, abundant currents of pure air being regarded
as no less essential to the perfect maturing of the
grape<a id='r1556' /><a href='#f1556' class='c012'><sup>[1556]</sup></a> than constant sunshine. Sometimes the vine,
in its ascent, was suffered to wind round the trunk
of its supporter, which, however, by the most judicious
husbandmen, was considered prejudicial, since
the profusion of ligatures which it threw out in its
passage upwards was thought to exhaust too much
of its strength, to prevent which wooden wedges<a id='r1557' /><a href='#f1557' class='c012'><sup>[1557]</sup></a>
were here and there inserted between the vine stem
and the tree. In trailing the branches, moreover,
along the boughs, care was taken to keep them as
much as possible on the upper side, that they might
enjoy a greater amount of sunshine, and be the more
exposed to be agitated by the winds.</p>

<p class='c001'>These Anadendrades,<a id='r1558' /><a href='#f1558' class='c012'><sup>[1558]</sup></a> which were supposed to produce
the best and most lasting wines, probably, as at
present, ripened their produce much later than the
other sorts of vines on account of the trees by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>they were shaded. In modern Crete,<a id='r1559' /><a href='#f1559' class='c012'><sup>[1559]</sup></a> where, however,
they are never pruned, their grapes seldom
ripen before November, and sometimes they furnish
the bazaar of Khania with fresh supplies till Christmas.
The same is the case also in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Occasionally, too, more especially in Cypros, the
Anadendrades grew to an enormous size. At Populonium,
in Etruria, there was a statue of Jupiter
carved from a single vine; the pillars of the temple
of Hera, at Metapontum, consisted of so many vines;
and the whole staircase leading to the roof of the
fane of Artemis, at Ephesos, was constructed with
the timber of a single vine from Cypros. To render
these things credible, we are informed, that, at
Arambys, in Africa,<a id='r1560' /><a href='#f1560' class='c012'><sup>[1560]</sup></a> there was a vine twelve feet
in circumference, and modern travellers have found
them of equal dimensions in other parts of the
world.<a id='r1561' /><a href='#f1561' class='c012'><sup>[1561]</sup></a> In France, for example, the celebrated
Anne, Duc de Montmorenci, had a table made
with a single slab of vinewood, which, two hundred
years afterwards, Brotier<a id='r1562' /><a href='#f1562' class='c012'><sup>[1562]</sup></a> saw preserved at the town
of Ecouen.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return, however: the wide spaces between the
trees were not in this class of vineyards allowed to
remain entirely idle, having been sometimes sown<a id='r1563' /><a href='#f1563' class='c012'><sup>[1563]</sup></a>
with corn, or planted with beans, and gourds, and
cucumbers, and lentils.<a id='r1564' /><a href='#f1564' class='c012'><sup>[1564]</sup></a> The cabbage<a id='r1565' /><a href='#f1565' class='c012'><sup>[1565]</sup></a> was carefully
excluded,<a id='r1566' /><a href='#f1566' class='c012'><sup>[1566]</sup></a> as an enemy to Dionysos. In other cases
these intervals were given up to the cultivation of
fruit-trees, such as the pomegranate, the apple, the
quince, and the olive. The fig-tree was regarded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>pernicious, though often planted in rows on the outside
of the vineyard.</p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting those vines which were cultivated without
the aid of props,<a id='r1567' /><a href='#f1567' class='c012'><sup>[1567]</sup></a> or trees, we possess little information,
except that there were such. But, as they
are still found in the country, it is probable, that
the mode of dressing them now prevailing nearly
resembles that of antiquity. They are generally, in
Syria, planted along the steep sides of mountains,
where they spread and rest upon the stones, and
have their fruit early ripened by the heat reflected
from the earth. Frequently, also, they are planted
on more level ground, in which case, as soon as
the grapes acquire any size, the husbandman passes
through the vineyard with an armful of forked
wooden props which he skilfully introduces beneath
the branches and fixes firmly so as to keep the
clusters from touching the mould. The reason for
adopting this method is the furious winds which
at certain seasons of the year prevail in many of
the Grecian islands, preventing the growth of woods
and prostrating the fig and every other fruit-tree to
the earth. The spaces between the lines are turned
up annually by a peculiar sort of plough<a id='r1568' /><a href='#f1568' class='c012'><sup>[1568]</sup></a> drawn by
oxen, in front of which a man advances, lifting up
the vines and holding them aside while they pass.
This destroys the weeds, and, at the same time, all
the upper roots of the vine, which compels it to
descend deeper into the earth, where it finds a
cooler and more abundant nourishment. In this
respect the practice of the Syrotes closely resembles
that of their ancestors. Some husbandmen were
careful, likewise, while weeding,<a id='r1569' /><a href='#f1569' class='c012'><sup>[1569]</sup></a> to remove the
larger stones, though they are often supposed, by
preserving moisture, to do more good than harm.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>It is a peculiar feature in the character of the
ancients that they loved to attribute to the inferior
animals the first hints of various useful practices.
Thus they maintained it was the ass that, by browsing
on the extremities of the vine, which only made
it bear the more luxuriantly, taught them the art
of pruning as well perhaps as that of feeding on
the tendrils and tender branches,<a id='r1570' /><a href='#f1570' class='c012'><sup>[1570]</sup></a> which among them
were esteemed a delicacy. To manifest their gratitude
for this piece of instruction they erected at
Nauplia,<a id='r1571' /><a href='#f1571' class='c012'><sup>[1571]</sup></a> a marble statue in honour of this ill-used
quadruped, who has seldom, I fear, from that day
to this, been so well treated. The rules observed
in pruning<a id='r1572' /><a href='#f1572' class='c012'><sup>[1572]</sup></a> resembling those still in use, it is unnecessary
to repeat them, though it may be worth
mentioning, that the husbandman, who coveted an
abundant vintage, was careful to lop his vines<a id='r1573' /><a href='#f1573' class='c012'><sup>[1573]</sup></a> with
his brows shaded by an ivy crown. They esteemed
it a sign of a fruitful year when the fig-tree and
the white vine put forth luxuriantly in spring,<a id='r1574' /><a href='#f1574' class='c012'><sup>[1574]</sup></a> after
which they had only to petition the gods against
too much rain, or too much drought,<a id='r1575' /><a href='#f1575' class='c012'><sup>[1575]</sup></a> and those
terrible hailstorms which sometimes devastate whole
districts. Against this calamity, however, they had
a preservative, which was to bind an amulet in the
shape of a thong of seal-hide or eagle’s wing, about
one of the stocks,<a id='r1576' /><a href='#f1576' class='c012'><sup>[1576]</sup></a> after which the whole vineyard
was supposed to be secure from injury. The same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>effect was produced by striking a chalezite stone
with a piece of iron on the approach of a storm,
and by hanging up in the vineyard a picture of a
bunch of grapes at the setting of the constellation
of the Lyre.<a id='r1577' /><a href='#f1577' class='c012'><sup>[1577]</sup></a> To repel the ascent of vermin along
the trunk it was smeared with a thick coat of bitumen,<a id='r1578' /><a href='#f1578' class='c012'><sup>[1578]</sup></a>
imported from Cilicia, while to preserve the
branches from wasps a little olive-oil was blown
over them.<a id='r1579' /><a href='#f1579' class='c012'><sup>[1579]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While the grapes were growing, the ancients, following
in the track of nature, supposed them to need
shade, since the leaves at that time put forth most
abundantly, to screen the young fruit from the scorching
sun; but when they began to don their gold or
purple hues, observing the foliage shrivel and shrink
from about them, in order to admit the warm rays
to penetrate and pervade the fruit they then stripped
the branches and hastened the vintage,<a id='r1580' /><a href='#f1580' class='c012'><sup>[1580]</sup></a> plucking
moreover the clusters as they ripened, lest they
should drop off and be lost. But this partial gathering
of the grapes could only take place in their
gardens, or where the vine was trained about the
house; for in the regular vineyards the season of
the vintage was regulated by law,<a id='r1581' /><a href='#f1581' class='c012'><sup>[1581]</sup></a> as in Burgundy
and the south of France, in order to protect the
public against the pernicious frauds which would
otherwise be practised. This, in Attica, usually coincided
with the heliacal rising of the constellation
Arcturus.<a id='r1582' /><a href='#f1582' class='c012'><sup>[1582]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When the magistrate had declared that the season
of the vintage<a id='r1583' /><a href='#f1583' class='c012'><sup>[1583]</sup></a> was come, the servants of Bacchos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>hurried forth to the vine-clad hills, converting
their labours into a pretext for superabundant mirth
and revelry. The troops of vintagers, composed of
youths and maidens, with crowns of ivy on their
heads, and accompanied by rural performers on the
flute or phorminx, moved forward with shout, and
dance, and song, to the sacred enclosures of Dionysos,
surrounded with plaited hedgerows, and blue
streamlets.<a id='r1584' /><a href='#f1584' class='c012'><sup>[1584]</sup></a> Here, where</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“——the showering grapes</div>
      <div class='line'>In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Purple and gushing,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>they at once commenced their joyous task. With
sharp pruning-hooks<a id='r1585' /><a href='#f1585' class='c012'><sup>[1585]</sup></a> they separated the luxuriant
clusters, gold or purple, from the vine, and piling
them in plaited baskets of osier or reed, bore them
on their shoulders to the wine-press. In this operation,
as I have said, both men and women joined;
but the press was trodden by men only,<a id='r1586' /><a href='#f1586' class='c012'><sup>[1586]</sup></a> who, half
intoxicated by pleasure,<a id='r1587' /><a href='#f1587' class='c012'><sup>[1587]</sup></a> and the fumes of the young
wine, chanted loudly their ancient national lays in
praise of Bacchos.</p>

<p class='c001'>The wine-press, which stood under cover, sometimes
consisted of two upright, and many cross
beams,<a id='r1588' /><a href='#f1588' class='c012'><sup>[1588]</sup></a> which, descending with great weight upon
the grapes squeezed forth all their juices, and these
falling through a species of strainer,<a id='r1589' /><a href='#f1589' class='c012'><sup>[1589]</sup></a> upon an inclined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>slab, were poured through a small channel
formed for the purpose, into a broad open vessel
communicating with the vat. Into the process
of wine-making<a id='r1590' /><a href='#f1590' class='c012'><sup>[1590]</sup></a> it is unnecessary to enter. It
will be sufficient, perhaps, to say that, when made,
it was laid up in skins or large earthen jars until
required for use. The wines of modern Attica and
the Morea<a id='r1591' /><a href='#f1591' class='c012'><sup>[1591]</sup></a> are preserved from becoming acid by
a large infusion of resin.<a id='r1592' /><a href='#f1592' class='c012'><sup>[1592]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The sports,<a id='r1593' /><a href='#f1593' class='c012'><sup>[1593]</sup></a> which took place during the vintage,
were loud and frolicsome, and distinguished sometimes
for their excessive licence. They brought
forth a number of wine skins, filled tight, to the
village green, and there smearing them liberally with
oil the staggering rustics sought, each in his turn,
to leap and stand upon one of them with his naked
foot.<a id='r1594' /><a href='#f1594' class='c012'><sup>[1594]</sup></a> The missing, slipping, and falling, the awkward
figure they sometimes made upon the ground,
the jokes, and shouts, and laughter of the bystanders,
mingled with the twanging of rustic instruments,
and the roar of Bacchanalian songs, constituted
the charm of the rural Dionysia, out of which,
through many changes and gradations, arose, as we
have seen, the Greek drama. In order without
shame to give the freer licence to their tongues,
they sometimes covered their faces with masks,
formed with the bark of trees, which, there can
be no doubt, led to those afterwards employed in
the theatre. Sometimes a sort of farce<a id='r1595' /><a href='#f1595' class='c012'><sup>[1595]</sup></a> was acted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>representing the search of the Athenians for the
bodies of Icarios and Erygone. The former, according
to tradition, was the person who taught the inhabitants
of Attica the use of wine, with which on
a certain occasion he regaled a number of shepherds.
These demi-savages, observing their strength and
their reason fail, imagined themselves to have been
poisoned, and falling, in revenge, upon the donor,
put him to death. His dog Mœra escaped, and
leading Erygone to the spot where her father had
been murdered, she immediately hung herself on
the discovery of the corpse. Upon this they were
all transported to the skies, and changed into so
many constellations, namely Boötes,<a id='r1596' /><a href='#f1596' class='c012'><sup>[1596]</sup></a> the Dog, and
the Virgin, by whose brilliancy we are still rejoiced
nightly. Soon afterwards the maidens of Attica
were seized with madness and hung themselves
in great numbers, upon which the oracle being consulted,
commanded the Athenians to make search
for the bodies of Icarios and Erygone. Being able
to discover them nowhere on earth, they suspended
ropes from the branches of lofty trees, by swinging
to and fro on which they appeared to be conducting
their search in the air; but many of these adventurous
explorers receiving severe falls, they were
afterwards contented with suspending to the ropes
little images after their own likeness, which they
sent hither and thither in the air as their substitutes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But all the produce of the vineyards was not appropriated
to the making of wine, great quantities
of grapes<a id='r1597' /><a href='#f1597' class='c012'><sup>[1597]</sup></a> being preserved for the table, or converted
into raisins.<a id='r1598' /><a href='#f1598' class='c012'><sup>[1598]</sup></a> The latter were sometimes
made by being carefully gathered after the full
moon, and put out to dry in the sun, about ten
o’clock in the morning, when all the dew was evaporated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>For this purpose, there was in every
vineyard, garden, and orchard, a place called Theilopedon,<a id='r1599' /><a href='#f1599' class='c012'><sup>[1599]</sup></a>
which would seem to have been a smooth
raised terrace, where not grapes only, but myrtle-berries,
and every other kind of fruit, were exposed
to the sun on fine hurdles. Here, likewise,
the berries of the Palma Christi<a id='r1600' /><a href='#f1600' class='c012'><sup>[1600]</sup></a> were prepared
for the making of castor oil. Another method was
to twist the stem of the cluster<a id='r1601' /><a href='#f1601' class='c012'><sup>[1601]</sup></a> and allow the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>grapes to dry on the vine. They were then laid
up in vessels among vine leaves, dried also in the
sun, covered close with a stopper, and deposited in
a cold room free from smoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>To preserve the grapes fresh some cut off with
a sharp pruninghook the clusters separately, others
the branches on which they grew, after which, dipping
the stem into pitch and removing the damaged
grapes with a pair of scissors, they spread them in
cool and shady rooms, on layers of pulse-halm, or
hay, or straw.<a id='r1602' /><a href='#f1602' class='c012'><sup>[1602]</sup></a> The halm of lentils was usually
preferred, because it is hard and dry, and repels
mice. On other occasions, the branches were kept
suspended, having sometimes been previously dipped
in sweet wine. Grapes were likewise preserved in
pitched coffers, immersed in dry saw-dust of the
pitch tree, or the silver fir, or the black poplar,
or even in millet flour. Others plunged the bunches
in boiling sea-water, or if this were not at hand,
into a preparation of wine, salt, and water, and then
laid them up in barley straw. Others boiled the
ashes of the fig-tree, or the vine, with which they
sprinkled the bunches. Others preserved grapes by
suspending them in granaries, where the grain beneath
was occasionally moved, for the dust rising
from the corn settled on the outside of the clusters,
and protected them from the air. Another
method was to boil rain-water to a third, and then,
after cooling it in the open air, and pouring it into
a pitched vessel, to fill it with clusters perfectly
cleansed. The vessel was then covered, luted with
gypsum, and laid by in a cold place. The grapes
in this way remained quite fresh, and the water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>itself acquiring a vinous taste was administered to
sick persons in lieu of wine. Occasionally, also,
grapes as well as apples were kept in honey.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most extraordinary, and perhaps the most effectual
contrivance,<a id='r1603' /><a href='#f1603' class='c012'><sup>[1603]</sup></a> however, was to dig near the
vine a pit three feet deep, the bottom of which
was covered with a layer of sand. A few short
stakes were then fixed upright in it, and to these
a number of vine branches laden with clusters were
bent down and made fast. The whole was then
closely roofed over so as completely to keep out
the rain, and in this way the grapes would remain
fresh till spring.</p>

<p class='c001'>The labours of the vintage being concluded, the
husbandman next turned his attention to olive gathering
and the making of oil. This, in Greece, was
a matter of great importance. The olives, therefore,<a id='r1604' /><a href='#f1604' class='c012'><sup>[1604]</sup></a>
for all the better sorts of oil, were picked by hand,
and not, as in Italy, suffered to fall. When as many
were gathered as could conveniently be pressed during
the following night and day, they were spread loosely
on fine hurdles, and not heaped up lest they should heat
and lose the delicacy of their flavour. They were, likewise,
cleansed carefully from leaves and every particle
of wood, these substances, it was supposed, impairing
the quality and durability of the oil. Towards evening
a little salt was sprinkled over the olives, which
were then put into a clean mill,<a id='r1605' /><a href='#f1605' class='c012'><sup>[1605]</sup></a> and so arranged
that they could be bruised without crushing the
stones, from the juice of which the oil contracted
a bad taste. Having been sufficiently bruised, they
were conveyed in small vessels to the press, where
they were covered with hurdles of green willows,
upon which, at first, was placed a moderate weight,—for
that which flows from slight pressure is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>sweetest and purest oil, on which account it was
drawn off in clean leaden vessels,<a id='r1606' /><a href='#f1606' class='c012'><sup>[1606]</sup></a> and preserved
apart. Greater weight was then added, and the mass
having been well writhen, the second runnings were
laid up in separate vessels. The next step was to
cause the precipitation of the lees, which was effected
by mingling with the crude oil a little salt and nitre.
It was then stirred with a piece of olive-wood, and
left to settle, when the amurca or watery part sank
to the bottom. The pure oil was then skimmed off
with a shell, and laid up in glass vases, this substance
having been preferred on account of its cold
nature. In default of these, pickle-jars, glazed with
gypsum, were used, which were deposited in cool
cellars facing the north.<a id='r1607' /><a href='#f1607' class='c012'><sup>[1607]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks had a variety of other oils besides that
procured from the olive,<a id='r1608' /><a href='#f1608' class='c012'><sup>[1608]</sup></a> as walnut-oil, oil of terebinth,
oil of sesamum, oil of violets, oil of almonds,
oil of Palma Christi, or castor-oil, oil of saffron, oil
of Cnidian laurel, oil of datura, oil of lentisk, oil
of mastic, oil of myrtle, and oil of mustard. They
had, likewise,<a id='r1609' /><a href='#f1609' class='c012'><sup>[1609]</sup></a> the green and wild-olive oil, and the
double-refined oil of Sicyon, together with imitations
of the Spanish and Italian oils.</p>

<p class='c001'>As fruit of all kinds was in great request among
the Greeks, they had recourse to numerous contrivances<a id='r1610' /><a href='#f1610' class='c012'><sup>[1610]</sup></a>
for ensuring an unfailing supply throughout
the year. At many of these our gardeners may,
perhaps, smile, but they were, nevertheless, most of
them ingenious, and, probably, effectual, though the
fruit thus preserved may have been dear when brought
to market. Into the details of all their methods it
will be unnecessary to enter: the following were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>principal and most curious. Walnuts, chestnuts,
filberts, &amp;c., were gathered and kept in the ordinary
way. They understood the art of blanching almonds,
which were afterwards dried in the sun. Medlars,
service-berries, winter-apples, and the like, having
been gathered carefully, were simply laid up in straw,
whether on the loft-floor or in baskets. This, likewise,
was sometimes the case with quinces, which,
together with apples and pears, were, on other occasions,
deposited in dry fig-leaves. For these, in the case
of pears and apples, walnut-leaves were often substituted,
sometimes piled under and over them in
heaps, at other times wrapped and tied about the
fruit, the hues and odours of which they were supposed
greatly to improve.</p>

<p class='c001'>Citrons,<a id='r1611' /><a href='#f1611' class='c012'><sup>[1611]</sup></a> pomegranates,<a id='r1612' /><a href='#f1612' class='c012'><sup>[1612]</sup></a> apples, quinces, and pears,
were preserved in heaps of sand, grapestones, oak,
poplar, deal, or cedar sawdust, sometimes sprinkled
with vinegar, chopped straw, wheat, or barley, or
the seeds of plants, all of which sufficed equally to
exclude the external air. Another method with
apples<a id='r1613' /><a href='#f1613' class='c012'><sup>[1613]</sup></a> was to lay them up surrounded with sea-weed
in unbaked jars, which were then deposited
in an upper room free from smoke and all bad
smells. When sea-weed was not procurable they
put each apple into a small separate jar closely
covered up and luted. These apple-jars were
often lined with a coating of wax. Figs were, in
like manner, preserved green<a id='r1614' /><a href='#f1614' class='c012'><sup>[1614]</sup></a> by being enclosed
in so many small gourds. Citrons and pomegranates
were often suffered to remain throughout the winter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>on the tree, defended from wet and wind by being
capped with little fictile vases bound tightly to the
branches to keep them steady. Others enclosed
these fruits, as well as apples, in a thick coating
of gypsum, preventing their falling off by binding
the stem to the branches with packthread. Nor
was it unusual, even when gathered, to envelope
apples, quinces, and citrons, in a covering of the
same material, or potter’s clay, or argillaceous earth,
mixed with hair, sometimes interposing between the
fruit and this crust a layer of fig-leaves, after which
they were dried in the sun. When at the end,
perhaps, of a whole year the above crust was broken
and removed the fruit came forth perfect as when
plucked from the bough. It is possible, therefore,
that, in a similar manner, mangoes, mangusteens, and
other frail and delicate fruit of the tropics, might
be brought fresh to Europe, and that, too, in such
abundance as to make them accessible to most persons.
To render pears and pomegranates durable,
their stems were dipped in pitch, after which they
were hung up. In the case of the latter the fruit
itself was sometimes thus dipped; and, at other times,
immersed in hot sea-water, after which it was dried in
the sun. One mode of preserving figs was to plunge
them in honey so as neither to touch each other,
nor the vessel in which they were contained; another,
to cover a pile of them with an inverted vase of
glass, or other pellucid substance, closely luted to
the slab on which it stood. Cherries were gathered
before sunrise, and put, with summer savory above
and below, into a jar, or the hollow of a reed, which
was then filled with sweet vinegar, and closely covered.
Mulberries were preserved in their own juice,
apples and quinces in pitched coffers, wrapped in
clean locks of wool, pears by being placed in salt<a id='r1615' /><a href='#f1615' class='c012'><sup>[1615]</sup></a>
for five days, and afterwards dried in the sun, as
were also figs, which were strung by the stalks to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>a piece of cord or willow twig, like so many hanks
of onions<a id='r1616' /><a href='#f1616' class='c012'><sup>[1616]</sup></a> as they are sold in modern times. Elsewhere
they were preserved, as dates in Egypt, by
being pressed together in square masses, like bricks.<a id='r1617' /><a href='#f1617' class='c012'><sup>[1617]</sup></a>
Damascenes were kept in must or sweet wine, as
were also pears, adding sometimes a little salt and
jujubes, with leaves, above and below. The same
course was pursued with apples and quinces, which
communicated to the liquor additional durability and
the most exquisite fragrance. Quinces, whose sharp
effluvia prevented their being placed with other fruit,
were often put into closely-covered jars, and kept
floating in wine to which they imparted a delicious
perfume. The same custom was observed with respect
to figs, which were cut off on the bearing
branch a little before they were ripe, and hung, so
as not to touch each other, in a square earthen
jar. Upon the same principle apples were preserved
in jars hermetically sealed, which, for the sake of
coolness, were plunged in cisterns or deep wells.<a id='r1618' /><a href='#f1618' class='c012'><sup>[1618]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It may, perhaps, be worth while to mention, in
passing, that, like ourselves, the ancients possessed
the art of extracting perry and cider<a id='r1619' /><a href='#f1619' class='c012'><sup>[1619]</sup></a> from their
pears and apples; and from pomegranates a species
of wine which is said to have been of an extremely
delicate flavour. The Egyptians, also, made wine
from the fruit of the lotos.<a id='r1620' /><a href='#f1620' class='c012'><sup>[1620]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV. <br /> STUDIES OF THE FARMER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In other branches of rural economy the country
gentlemen of Attica exhibited no less enthusiasm
or skill. Indeed, throughout Greece, there prevailed
a similar taste. Every one was eager to instruct
and be instructed; and so great in consequence
was the demand for treatises on husbandry,
theoretical and practical, that numerous writers, the
names of fifty of whom are preserved by Varro,<a id='r1621' /><a href='#f1621' class='c012'><sup>[1621]</sup></a>
made it the object of their study. Others without
committing the result of their experience to writing,
devoted themselves wholly to its practical improvement.
They purchased waste or ill-cultivated lands,
and, by investigating the nature of the soil, skilfully
adapting their crops to it, manuring, irrigating, and
draining, converted a comparative desert into a productive
estate.<a id='r1622' /><a href='#f1622' class='c012'><sup>[1622]</sup></a> We can possibly, as Dr. Johnson
insists, improve very little our knowledge of agriculture
by erudite researches into the methods of
the ancients; though Milton was of opinion, that
even here some useful hints might be obtained.
In describing, however, what the Greeks did, I am
not pretending to enlighten the present age, but
to enable it to enjoy its superiority by instituting a
comparison with the ruder practices of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Already in those times the men of experience
and routine,<a id='r1623' /><a href='#f1623' class='c012'><sup>[1623]</sup></a> had begun to vent their sneers against
philosophers for their profound researches into the
nature of soils,<a id='r1624' /><a href='#f1624' class='c012'><sup>[1624]</sup></a> in which, however, they by no means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>designed to engage the husbandman, but only to
present him, in brief and intelligible maxims, with
the fruit of their labours. Nevertheless the practical
husbandman went to work a shorter way. He
observed his neighbour’s grounds,<a id='r1625' /><a href='#f1625' class='c012'><sup>[1625]</sup></a> saw what throve
in this soil, what in the other, what was bettered
by irrigation, what in this respect might safely be
left to the care of Heaven; and thus, in a brief
space, acquired a rough theory wherewith to commence
operations. An agriculturist, the Athenians
thought, required no recondite erudition, though to
his complete success the exercise of much good sense
and careful observation was necessary. Every man
would, doubtless, know in what seasons of the year
he must plough and sow and reap, that lands exhausted
by cultivation must be suffered to lie fallow,
that change of crops is beneficial to the soil, and so
on. But the great art consists in nicely adapting
each operation to the varying march of the seasons,
in converting accidents to use, in rendering the
winds, the showers, the sunshine, subservient to your
purposes, in mastering the signs of the weather, and
guarding as far as possible against the injuries sustained
from storms of rain or hail.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was in circulation among the Greeks a
small body of precepts, addressed more especially to
husbandmen, designed to promote the real object of
civilisation. Quaint, no doubt, and ineffably commonplace,
they will now appear, but they served,
nevertheless, in early and rude times, to soften the
manners and regulate the conduct of the rustic Hellenes.
Who first began to collect and preserve them
is, of course, unknown; they are thickly sprinkled
through the works of Hesiod,<a id='r1626' /><a href='#f1626' class='c012'><sup>[1626]</sup></a> and impart to them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>an air of moral dignity which relieves the monotony
that would otherwise result from a mere string of
agricultural maxims. The chief aim of the poet
seems to be, to promote peace and good neighbourhood,
to multiply among the inhabitants of the fields
occasions of joining the “rough right hand,”<a id='r1627' /><a href='#f1627' class='c012'><sup>[1627]</sup></a> to apply
the sharp spur to industry, and thus to augment
the stores, and, along with them, the contentment,
of his native land. Be industrious, exclaims the
poet, for famine is the companion of the idle. Labour
confers fertility on flocks and herds, and is the
parent of opulence. He who toils is beloved by
gods<a id='r1628' /><a href='#f1628' class='c012'><sup>[1628]</sup></a> and men, while the idle hand is the object
of their aversion. The slothful man envies the prosperity
of his neighbour; but glory is the reward of
virtue. Prudence heaps up that which profligacy
dissipates. Be hospitable to the stranger, for he
who repels the suppliant from his door is no less
guilty than the adulterer, than the despoiler of the
orphan, or the wretch who blasphemes his aged
parent on the brink of the grave: of such men the
end is miserable, when Zeus rains down vengeance
upon them in recompense for their evil actions. Be
mindful that thou offer up victims to the gods with
pure hands and holy thoughts,—to pour libations in
their temples, adorn their altars, and render them
propitious to thee in all things. When about to
ascend thy couch to enjoy sweet sleep, and when
the sacred light of the day-spring first appears, omit
not to demand of heaven a pure heart and a cheerful
mind, with the means of extending thy possessions,
and protection from loss. When thou makest
a feast, invite thy friends and thy neighbours, and
in times of trouble they will run to thy assistance
half-clad, while thy relations will tarry to buckle
on their girdles. Borrow of thy neighbour, but, in
repaying him, exceed rather than fall short of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>is his due. Rise betimes. Every little makes a
mickle. Store is no sore. Housed corn breaks no
sleep. Drink largely the top and the bottom of the
jar; be sparing of the middle:<a id='r1629' /><a href='#f1629' class='c012'><sup>[1629]</sup></a> it is niggardly to
stint your friends when the wine runs low. Do unto
others as they do unto you.—These seeds of morality
are simple, as I have said, and far from recondite;
but they produced the warriors of Marathon and
Platæa, and preserved for ages the freedom and the
independence of Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other branches of an Hellenic farmer’s studies
comprehended something like the elements of natural
philosophy,—the influence of the sun and moon, the
rising and setting of the stars, the motion of the
winds, the generation and effects of dews, clouds,
meteors, showers and tempests, the origin of springs
and fountains, and the migrations and habits of
birds and other animals. In addition to these things,
it was necessary that he should be acquainted with
certain practices, prevalent from time immemorial in
his country, and, probably, deriving their origin from
ages beyond the utmost reach of tradition. The source
of these we usually denominate superstition, though it
would, perhaps, be more proper to regard them as
the offspring of that lively and plastic fancy which
gave birth to poetry and art, and inclined its possessors
to create a sort of minor religion, based on a
praiseworthy principle, but developing itself chiefly
in observances almost always minute and trifling, and
sometimes ridiculous. To describe all these at length
would be beside my present purpose, which only requires
that I mention by the way the more remarkable
of those connected especially with agriculture.</p>

<p class='c001'>The knowledge of soil was called into play both
in purchasing estates and in appropriating their several
parts to different kinds of culture. According to
their notions, which appear to have been founded
on long experience, and in most points, I believe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>agree with those which still prevail, a rich black
mould, deep, friable, and porous,<a id='r1630' /><a href='#f1630' class='c012'><sup>[1630]</sup></a> which would resist
equally the effects of rain and drought, was, for all
purposes, the best. Next to this they esteemed a
yellow alluvial soil, and that sweet warm ground
which best suited vines, corn, and trees. The red
earth, also, they highly valued, except for timber.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their rules for detecting the character and qualities
of the soil appear to have been judicious.
Good land, they thought, might be known even from
its appearance, since in drought it cracks not too
much, and during heavy and continued showers becomes
not miry, but suffers all the rain to sink
into its bosom. That earth they considered inferior
which in cold weather becomes baked, and is covered
on the surface by a shell-like incrustation. They
judged, likewise, of the virtue of the soil by the luxuriant
or stunted character of its natural productions:<a id='r1631' /><a href='#f1631' class='c012'><sup>[1631]</sup></a>
thus they augured favourably of those tracts
of country which were covered by vast and lofty
timber-trees, while such as produced only a dwarfed
vegetation, consisting of meagre bushes, scattered
thickets, and hungry grass, they reckoned almost
worthless.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not content with the testimony of the eye, some
husbandmen were accustomed to consult both the
smell and the taste; for, digging a pit of some depth,
they took thence a small quantity of earth, from the
odour of which they drew an opinion favourable or
otherwise. But to render surety doubly sure, they
then threw it into a vase, and poured on it a quantity
of potable water, which they afterwards tasted,
inferring from the flavour the fertility or barrenness
of the soil. This was the experiment most relied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>on; though many considered that soil sweet which
produced the basket-rush, the reed, the lotos, and
the bramble. On some occasions they employed another
method, which was, to make a small excavation,
and then, throwing back the earth into the
opening whence it had been drawn, to observe whether
or not it filled the whole cavity:<a id='r1632' /><a href='#f1632' class='c012'><sup>[1632]</sup></a> if it did so, or
left a surplus, the soil was judged to be excellent;
if not, they regarded it as of little value. Soils
possessing saline qualities were shunned by the ancients,
who carefully avoided mingling salt with their
manure, though lands of this description were rightly
thought to be well adapted to the cultivation of
palm-trees,<a id='r1633' /><a href='#f1633' class='c012'><sup>[1633]</sup></a> which they produce in the greatest perfection,<a id='r1634' /><a href='#f1634' class='c012'><sup>[1634]</sup></a>
as in Phœnicia, Egypt, and the country round
Babylon.<a id='r1635' /><a href='#f1635' class='c012'><sup>[1635]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another art in which the condition of the husbandman
required him to be well versed was that
of discovering the signs of latent springs,<a id='r1636' /><a href='#f1636' class='c012'><sup>[1636]</sup></a> the existence
of which it was necessary to ascertain before
laying the foundation of a new farm. The investigation
was complicated, and carried on in a variety
of ways. First, and most obvious, was the inference
drawn from plants and the nature of the soil itself; for
those grounds, they thought, were intersected below by
veins of water which bore upon their surface certain
tribes of grasses and herbs and bushes, as the couch-grass,
the broad-leaved plantain, the heliotrope, the
red-grass, the agnus-castus, the bramble, the horse-tail,
or shave-grass, ivy, bush-calamint, soft and slender
reeds,<a id='r1637' /><a href='#f1637' class='c012'><sup>[1637]</sup></a> maiden-hair, the melilot, ditch-dock, cinquefoil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>or five leaf-grass, broad-leaved bloodwort, the
rush, nightshade, mil-foil, colt’s-foot or foal’s-foot, trefoil
or pond-weed, and the black thistle. Spring-heads
were always supposed to lurk beneath fat and black
loam, as, likewise, in a stony soil, especially where
the rocks are dark and of a ferruginous colour. But
in argillaceous districts, particularly where potter’s-clay
abounds, or where there are many pebbles and
pumice-stones,<a id='r1638' /><a href='#f1638' class='c012'><sup>[1638]</sup></a> they are of rare occurrence.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the above indications they were in most cases
careful to add others. Ascending ere sunrise to a
higher level than the spot under examination, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>observed by the first rays and before the light thickened,
whether they could detect the presence of any
exhalations, which were held unerringly to indicate
the presence of springs below. Sometimes inquisition
was made during the bright and clear noon,
when the subterraneous retreats of the Naiads were
supposed in summer to be betrayed by cloudlets of
thin silvery vapour, and in the winter season by
curling threads of steam. In this way the natives
of southern Africa discover the existence of hidden
fountains in the desert.<a id='r1639' /><a href='#f1639' class='c012'><sup>[1639]</sup></a> Swarms of gnats flitting
hither and thither, or whirling round and ascending
in a column, were regarded as another sign.</p>

<p class='c001'>When not entirely satisfied by any of the above
means, they had recourse to the following experiment:<a id='r1640' /><a href='#f1640' class='c012'><sup>[1640]</sup></a>
sinking a pit to the depth of about four feet
and a half, they took a hemispherical pan or lead
basin, and having anointed it with oil, and fastened
with wax a long flake of wool to the bottom, placed
it inverted in the pit. It was then covered with
earth about a foot deep, and left undisturbed during
a whole night. On its being taken forth in
the morning, if the inside of the vessel were covered
thickly with globules, and the wool were dripping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>wet, it was concluded there were springs beneath,
the depth of which they calculated from the scantiness
or profusion of the moisture. A similar trial
was made with a sponge covered with reeds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since most streams and rivers take their rise in
lofty table-lands or mountains, which by the ancients
were supposed to be richer in springs in proportion
to the number of their peaks, it would seem
to follow, that scarcely any country in Europe
should be better supplied with water than Greece.
Experience, however, shows, that this in modern
times is not the fact, several rivers supposed to
have been of great volume in antiquity, having
now dwindled into mere brooks, and innumerable
streamlets and fountains become altogether dry; on
which account the credit of Greek writers is often
impugned, it being supposed that the natural characteristics
of the country must necessarily be invariable.
But this is an error. For the existence of
springs and rivulets depends less perhaps on the
presence of mountains than on the prevalence of
forests, as Democritos<a id='r1641' /><a href='#f1641' class='c012'><sup>[1641]</sup></a> long ago observed. Now,
from a variety of causes, still in active operation,
the ridges and hills and lower eminences of modern
Greece have been almost completely denuded
of trees, along with which have necessarily
disappeared the well-springs, and runnels, and cascades,
and rills, and mountain tarns, which anciently
shed beauty and fertility over the face of Hellas,
whose highlands were once so densely clad with
woods<a id='r1642' /><a href='#f1642' class='c012'><sup>[1642]</sup></a> that the peasants requiring a short cut from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>one valley to another, were compelled to clear themselves
a pathway with the axe.<a id='r1643' /><a href='#f1643' class='c012'><sup>[1643]</sup></a> To restore to
Greece, therefore, its waters, and the beauty and
riches depending on them, the mountains must be
again forested, and severe restraint put on the wantonness
of those vagrant shepherds who constantly
expose vast woods to the risk of entire destruction
for the sake of procuring more delicate grass for
their flocks.<a id='r1644' /><a href='#f1644' class='c012'><sup>[1644]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In Attica,<a id='r1645' /><a href='#f1645' class='c012'><sup>[1645]</sup></a> both fields and gardens were chiefly
irrigated by means of wells which, sometimes, in
extremely long and dry summers, failed entirely,
thus causing a scarcity of vegetables.<a id='r1646' /><a href='#f1646' class='c012'><sup>[1646]</sup></a> The water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>we find, was drawn up by precisely the same machinery
as is still employed for the purpose.
The invention of these conveniences of primary
necessity having preceded the birth of tradition,
has, by some writers, been attributed to Danaos,
who is supposed to have emigrated from Egypt into
Greece. Arriving, we are told, at Argos, he, upon
the failure of spontaneous fountains, taught the inhabitants
to dig wells, in consequence of which he
was elected chief. But where was Danaos himself
to have learned this art? He is said to have been
an Egyptian, and Egypt is a country so entirely
without springs, that two only exist within its limits,
and of these but one was known to the ancients.
Of wells they had none. Danaos could, therefore,
if he was an Egyptian, have known nothing of
springs or wells; and, if he had such knowledge, he
must have come from some other land.<a id='r1647' /><a href='#f1647' class='c012'><sup>[1647]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Where there existed neither wells nor fountains,
people were compelled to depend on rain-water, collected
and preserved in cisterns.<a id='r1648' /><a href='#f1648' class='c012'><sup>[1648]</sup></a> For this purpose
troughs were in some farm-houses run along the
eaves both of the stables, barns, and sheep-cotes, as
well as of the dwelling of the family, while others
used only that which ran from the last, the roof of
which was kept scrupulously clean. The water was
conveyed through wooden pipes<a id='r1649' /><a href='#f1649' class='c012'><sup>[1649]</sup></a> to the cisterns,
which appear to have been frequently situated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>the front court.<a id='r1650' /><a href='#f1650' class='c012'><sup>[1650]</sup></a> Bad water they purified in several
ways: by casting into it a little coral powder,<a id='r1651' /><a href='#f1651' class='c012'><sup>[1651]</sup></a> small
linen bags of bruised barley, or a quantity of laurel
leaves, or by pouring it into broad tubs and exposing
it for a considerable time to the action of
the sun and air. When there happened to be about
the farms ponds of any magnitude, they introduced
into them a number of eels or river crabs, which
opened the veins of the earth and destroyed leeches.</p>

<p class='c001'>A scarcely less important branch of the farmer’s
studies was that which related to the weather and
the general march of the seasons.<a id='r1652' /><a href='#f1652' class='c012'><sup>[1652]</sup></a> Above all things,
it behoved him to observe diligently the rising and
setting of the sun and moon. He was, likewise,
carefully to note the state of the atmosphere at the
disappearance of the Pleiades, since it was expected
to continue the same until the winter solstice, after
which a change sometimes immediately supervened,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>otherwise there was usually no alteration till the
vernal equinox.<a id='r1653' /><a href='#f1653' class='c012'><sup>[1653]</sup></a> Another variation then took place
in the character of the weather, which afterwards
remained fixed till the rising of the Pleiades, undergoing
successively fresh mutations at the summer
solstice and the autumnal equinox. According to
their observations, moreover, a rainy winter<a id='r1654' /><a href='#f1654' class='c012'><sup>[1654]</sup></a> was
followed by a dry and raw spring, and the contrary;
and a snowy winter by a year of abundance. But
as nature by no means steadily follows this course,
exhibiting many sudden and abrupt fluctuations, it
was found necessary to subject her restless phenomena
to a more rigid scrutiny, in order that rules
might be obtained for foretelling the approach of
rain, or tempests, or droughts, or a continuance of
fair weather. Of these some, possibly, were founded
on imperfect observation or casual coincidences, or
a fanciful linking of causes and effects; while others,
we cannot doubt, sprang from a practical familiarity
with the subtler and more shifting elements of natural
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>As nothing more obviously interests the husbandman
than the seasonable arrival and departure of
rains, everything connected with them, however remotely,
was observed and treasured up with scrupulous
accuracy. Of all the circumstances pre-signifying
their approach the most certain was supposed
to be the aspect of the morning; for if, before sunrise,
beds of purpurescent clouds<a id='r1655' /><a href='#f1655' class='c012'><sup>[1655]</sup></a> stretched along
the verge of the horizon, rain was expected that
day, or the day after the morrow. The same augury
they drew, though with less confidence, from the appearance
of the setting sun,<a id='r1656' /><a href='#f1656' class='c012'><sup>[1656]</sup></a> especially if in winter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>or spring it went down through an accumulation
of clouds or with masses of dusky rack on the left.
Again, if, on rising, the sun looked pale, dull red,
or spotted;<a id='r1657' /><a href='#f1657' class='c012'><sup>[1657]</sup></a> or, if, previously, its rays were seen
streaming upwards;<a id='r1658' /><a href='#f1658' class='c012'><sup>[1658]</sup></a> or, if, immediately afterwards,
a long band of clouds extended beneath it, intersecting
its descending beams; or if the orient wore a
sombre hue; or if piles of sable vapour towered into
the welkin; or if the clouds were scattered loosely
over the sky like fleeces of wool;<a id='r1659' /><a href='#f1659' class='c012'><sup>[1659]</sup></a> or came waving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>up from the south in long sinuous streaks—the
“mares’ tails” of our nautical vocabulary—the husbandman
reckoned with certainty upon rain, floods,
and tempestuous winds. Among the signs of showers
peculiar to the site of Athens may be reckoned these
following: if a rampart of white ground-fogs begirt
at night the basis of Hymettos; or, if its summits
were capped with vapour;<a id='r1660' /><a href='#f1660' class='c012'><sup>[1660]</sup></a> or, if troops of mists
settled in the hollow of the smaller mount, called
the Springless; or, if a single cloud rested on the
fane of Zeus at Ægina.<a id='r1661' /><a href='#f1661' class='c012'><sup>[1661]</sup></a> The violent roaring of the
sea upon the beach was the forerunner of a gale,
and they were enabled to conjecture from what
quarter it was to blow, by the movements of the
waters, which retreated from the shore before a north
wind; while, at the approach of the sirocco, they
were piled up higher than usual against the cliffs.
Elsewhere, in Attica, they supposed wet weather
to be foretold by the summits of Eubœa rising clear,
sharp, and unusually elevated through a dense floor
of exhalations, which, when they mounted and gathered
in blowing weather about the peaks of Caphareus,<a id='r1662' /><a href='#f1662' class='c012'><sup>[1662]</sup></a>
on the eastern shores of the island, presaged
an impending storm of five days’ continuance.
But here these signs concerned rather the mariner
than the husbandman, since the cliffs that stretched
along this coast are rugged and precipitous, and
the approaches so dangerous that few vessels which
are driven on it escape. Scarcely are the crews
able to save themselves, unless their bark happen
to be extremely light. Another portent of foul weather
was the apparition of a circle about the moon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>while, by the double reflection of its orb north and
south, that luminary appeared to be multiplied into
three. At night, also, if the nubecula,<a id='r1663' /><a href='#f1663' class='c012'><sup>[1663]</sup></a> called the
Manger, in the constellation of the Crab, shone
less luminously, it betokened a similar state of the
atmosphere. A like inference<a id='r1664' /><a href='#f1664' class='c012'><sup>[1664]</sup></a> was drawn when
the moon at three days old rose dusky; or, with
blunt horns; or, with its rim, or whole disk, red;
or blotted with black spots; or encircled by two
halos.<a id='r1665' /><a href='#f1665' class='c012'><sup>[1665]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The phenomena of thunder and lightning, likewise,
instructed the husbandman who was studious
in the language of the heavens: thus, when thunder
was heard in winter or in the morning, it betokened
wind; in the evening or at noon, in summer,
rain; when it lightened from every part of
the heavens, both. Falling stars<a id='r1666' /><a href='#f1666' class='c012'><sup>[1666]</sup></a> likewise denoted
wind or rain, originating in that part of the heavens
where they appeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among our own rustics the whole philosophy of
rainbows has been compressed into a couple of distichs:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A rainbow at night</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the shepherd’s delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>A rainbow in the morning</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the shepherd’s warning.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And upon this subject,<a id='r1667' /><a href='#f1667' class='c012'><sup>[1667]</sup></a> the peasants of Hellas
had little more to say; their opinion having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>that, in proportion to the number of rainbows, would
be the fury and continuance of the showers with
which they were threatened.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other signs of mutation in the atmosphere they
discovered in almost every part of nature; for example,
when bubbles rose on the surface of a river
they looked for a fall of rain; as also when small
land-birds were seen drenching their plumage; when
the crow was beheld washing his head upon the
rocky beach,<a id='r1668' /><a href='#f1668' class='c012'><sup>[1668]</sup></a> or the raven flapping his wings, while
with his voice he imitated amidst his croaking the
pattering of drops of rain; when the peasant was
awakened in the morning by the cry of the passing
crane,<a id='r1669' /><a href='#f1669' class='c012'><sup>[1669]</sup></a> or the shrill note of the chaffinch within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>his dwelling. Flights of island birds flocking to the
continent,<a id='r1670' /><a href='#f1670' class='c012'><sup>[1670]</sup></a> preceded drought; as a number of jackdaws
and ravens flying up and down, and imitating
the scream of the hawk, did rain. The
incessant shrieks of the screech-owl and the vehement
cawing of the crow, heard during a serene
night, foretold the approach of storms. The
barn-door fowl and the house-dog also played the
part of soothsayers, teaching their master to dread
impending storms by rolling themselves in the dust.
Of similar import was the flocking of geese with
noise to their food, or the skimming of swallows
along the surface of the water.<a id='r1671' /><a href='#f1671' class='c012'><sup>[1671]</sup></a> Again, when troops
of dolphins were seen rolling near the shore, or oxen
licking their fore-hoofs, or looking southwards, or,
with a suspicious air, snuffing the elements,<a id='r1672' /><a href='#f1672' class='c012'><sup>[1672]</sup></a> or
going bellowing to their stalls; when wolves approached
the homesteads; when flies bit sharp,<a id='r1673' /><a href='#f1673' class='c012'><sup>[1673]</sup></a> or
frogs croaked vociferously, or the ruddock, or land-toad,
crept into the water; when the salamander lizard
appeared, and the note of the green-frog was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>heard in the trees, the rustic donned his capote,
and prepared, like Anaxagoras at Olympia,<a id='r1674' /><a href='#f1674' class='c012'><sup>[1674]</sup></a> for a
shower. The flight of the storm-birds, kepphoi,<a id='r1675' /><a href='#f1675' class='c012'><sup>[1675]</sup></a>
was supposed to indicate a tempest from the point
of the heavens towards which they flew. When
in bright and windless weather clouds of cobwebs,<a id='r1676' /><a href='#f1676' class='c012'><sup>[1676]</sup></a>
floated through the air, the husbandman anticipated
a drenching for his fields, as also when earthen pots
and brass pans emitted sparks; when lamps spat;
when the wick made mushrooms;<a id='r1677' /><a href='#f1677' class='c012'><sup>[1677]</sup></a> when a halo encircled
its flame,<a id='r1678' /><a href='#f1678' class='c012'><sup>[1678]</sup></a> or when the flame itself was dusky.
The housewife was forewarned of coming hail-storms,
generally from the north, by a profusion of bright
sparks appearing on the surface of her charcoal fire;
when her feet swelled she knew that the wind would
blow from the south.<a id='r1679' /><a href='#f1679' class='c012'><sup>[1679]</sup></a> Heaps of clouds like burnished
copper rising after rain in the west portended
fine weather; as did likewise the tops of
lofty mountains, as Athos, Ossa, and Olympos, appearing
sharply defined against the sky; while an
apparent augmentation in the height of promontories
and the number of islands foreshowed wind.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1638'>1638</a>. Spallanzani, in his scientific
Travels in the Two Sicilies, describes
and explains the cause of
the rarity of springs in volcanic
countries. In some districts
among the roots of Ætna the female
peasants are compelled to
travel ten miles, at certain seasons
of the year, in search of
water, a jar of which costs, consequently,
almost a day’s journey. vol.
i. p. 299, sqq. In another part of
the same work he investigates the
origin of springs in the Æolian
isles, which he illustrates by the
example of Stromboli. iv. 128.
In this island there are two fountains,
one of slightly tepid water,
at the foot of the mountain, the
other on its slope. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Je recontrai,”</span>
observes Monsieur Dolomieu,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“à moitié hauteur une
source d’eau froide, douce, légère
et très bonne à boire, qui ne
tarit jamais et qui est l’unique
ressourse des habitans
lorsque leurs cîternes sont épuisées
et lorsque les chaleurs ont
desséché une seconde source qui
est au pied de la montagne
ce qui arrive tous les étés.”</span>
He then adds with reason: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Cette
petite fontaine dans ce lieu très
élevé au milieu des cendres
volcaniques, est très remarquable,
elle ne peut avoir son réservoir
que dans une pointe
de montagne isolée, toute de
sable et de pierres poreuses, matières
qui ne peuvent point
retenir l’eau, puisqu’elles sont
perméables à la fumée.” Voyage
aux Iles de Lipari,</span> t. i. p.
120. He then endeavours to account
for its existence by evaporation.
In the island of Saline,
among the same Æolian group,
there is another never-failing
spring, which, as some years no
rain falls in these islands during
the space of nine months, has
greatly perplexed the theories of
naturalists. Spallanzani conceives,
however, that the phenomenon
may be explained in the usual
way: “It appears to me,” he
says, “extremely probable, that
in the internal parts of an
island which, like this, is the
work of fire, there may be immense
caverns that may be filled
with water by the rains;
and that in some of these which
are placed above the spring,
the water may always continue
at nearly the same height.”

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1639'>1639</a>. Le Vaillant, t. viii. p. 162.
Even in the southern provinces of
France, the discovery of hidden
springs is an art of no mean importance;
and the persons who
possess it are regarded as public
benefactors. Thus, as I learn
from my friend M. Louis Froment,
of the department of the
Lot, M. Paramelle, a curé having
a living in that part of the
country, is held in high estimation
on account of the power
he possesses of discovering the
lurking retreats of spring-heads.
He is able, from a certain distance,
and without the least hesitation,
to point out the source of
living water, determine the depth
at which it is to be found, say,
without ever falling into error,
what is the quantity and what
the quality of the water. Without
seeking to penetrate the plan,
of which he keeps the secret, his
countrymen avail themselves of
the advantages offered to them;
and the inhabitants of one village,
situated on a calcareous tableland,
have discovered, by the
assistance of M. Paramelle, a
source in their market-place,
whilst before they were compelled
to seek water at a distance of five
miles.</p>

great, the progress of civilisation
has been inimical to forests. Thus
in the little island of Stromboli,
containing about a thousand inhabitants,
attempts were made
towards the end of the eighteenth
century to enlarge the cultivable
ground by clearing away the
woods. Spallanzani, Travels in

seq. The difficulty of extirpating
trees is illustrated by Theophrastus
who relates that, in a spot
near Pheneon in Arcadia, a well-wooded
tract was overflowed by
the water and the trees destroyed.
Next year, when the flood had
subsided and the mud dried, each
kind of tree appeared in the situation
which it had formerly occupied.
The willow, the elm, the
pine, and the fir, growing in its
own place, doubtless from the
roots of the former trees. Hist.

of graine to insue; if a
whole worm, like a gentill or

murren of beasts and cattle;
if a spider, then (saie they)
we shall have a pestilence or
some such like sickness to followe

things the learned, also, have
observed and noted: for Mathiolus,
writing upon Dioscorides
saith, that before they

they conteine in them either
a flie, a spider, or a worme;

exhibit, as most travellers
will have observed, a variety of
gorgeous phenomena, which, as
betokening certain states of the
atmosphere serve as so many admonitions
to the husbandman.
The sun before going down “assumed,”
observes Dr. Chandler,
“a variety of fantastic shapes.
It was surrounded, first, with
a golden glory of great extent,
and flamed upon the surface of
the sea in a long column of
fire. The lower half of the
orb soon after emerged in the
horizon, the other portion remaining
very large and red,
with half of a smaller orb beneath
it, and separate, but in
the same direction, the circular
rim approaching the line of its
diameter. These two, by degrees,
united, and then changed
rapidly into different figures,
until the resemblance was that
of a capacious punch-bowl inverted.
The rim of the bottom
extending upward, and
the body lengthening below
it, became a mushroom on a
stalk with a round head. It
was next metamorphosed into
a flaming caldron, of which
the lid, rising up, swelled
nearly into an orb and vanished.
The other portion put
on several uncircular forms,
and, after many twinklings and
faint glimmerings, slowly disappeared,
quite red, leaving the
clouds hanging over the dark
rocks on the Barbary shore finely
tinged with a vivid bloody
hue.” Travels, i. p. 4. Appearances
similar, though of inferior
brilliance and variety, are
sometimes witnessed in the Western
Hemisphere. Describing the
beauties of an evening on the Canadian
shore, Sir R. H. Bonnycastle
observes: “First, there
was a double sun by reflection,
each disk equally distinct;
afterwards, when the
orb reached the mark x, a solid
body of light, equal in breadth
with the sun itself, but of great
length from the shore, shot
down on the sea, and remained
like a broad fiery golden column,
or bar, until the black
high land hid the luminary
itself.” The Canadas in 1841.

the ancients held a curious
opinion, which Lord Bacon thus
expounds:—“It hath been observed
by the ancients, that
where a rainbow seemeth to
hang over or to touch, there
breathed forth a sweet smell.
The cause is, for that this happeneth
but in certain matters
which have in themselves some
sweetness, which the gentle dew
of the rainbow doth draw forth,
and the like to soft showers, for
they also make the ground
sweet, but none are so delicate as
the dew of the rainbow where
it falleth.” Sylva Sylvarum.
832. His Lordship here, as in
many other places, adopts the
explanation of the Peripatetics
while he seems to be himself
assigning the cause of the phenomenon.
Aristotle (Problem.
12. 3) enters fully into the
subject, which appears to have
been brought under the notice
of philosophers by the shepherds
who had observed that when certain
thickets had been laid in
ashes the passing of a rainbow
over the spot caused a sweet
odour to exhale from it. The
same fact is noticed by Theophrastus,
De Caus. Plant. 6. 17.

</div>

<p class='c011'>If we now pass to the actual labours of the farm,
and the implements by which they were usually carried
on, we shall find that the Grecian husbandman
was no way deficient in invention, or in that ingenuity
by which men have in all countries sought to
diminish their toils. For the purpose of procuring
at a cheap rate whatever was wanted for the use
of the establishment,<a id='r1680' /><a href='#f1680' class='c012'><sup>[1680]</sup></a> smiths, carpenters, and potters,
were kept upon the land or in its immediate neighbourhood;
by which means also the necessity was
avoided of often sending the farm-servants to the
neighbouring town, where it was observed they contracted
bad habits, and were rendered more vicious
and slothful.<a id='r1681' /><a href='#f1681' class='c012'><sup>[1681]</sup></a> Waggons, therefore, and carts, and
ploughs, and harrows, were constructed on the spot,
though it was sometimes necessary perhaps to obtain
from a distance the timber used for these implements,
which was generally cut in winter-time. They exhibited
much nicety in their choice of wood. Thus
they would have the poplar or mulberry-tree for the
felloes of their wheels; the ash, the ilex, and the
oxya, for the axle-tree, and fine close-grained maple
for the yokes of their oxen,<a id='r1682' /><a href='#f1682' class='c012'><sup>[1682]</sup></a> sometimes carved in
the form of serpents which seemed to wind round
the necks of the animals, and project their heads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>on either side.<a id='r1683' /><a href='#f1683' class='c012'><sup>[1683]</sup></a> Their harrows, it is probable, were
formed like our own. The construction of the
plough,<a id='r1684' /><a href='#f1684' class='c012'><sup>[1684]</sup></a> always continued to be extremely simple.
In the age of Hesiod<a id='r1685' /><a href='#f1685' class='c012'><sup>[1685]</sup></a> it consisted of four parts,
the handle, the socket, the coulter, and the beam;
and very little alteration seems afterwards to have
been made in its form or structure, till the introduction
of the wheel-plough, which did not, it is
believed, occur until after the age of Virgil. The
more primitive instrument, however, would seem to
have consisted originally of two parts only, one
serving the purpose of handle, socket, and share, the
other being the beam by which it was fastened to
the yoke. In the antique implement<a id='r1686' /><a href='#f1686' class='c012'><sup>[1686]</sup></a> the beam was
sometimes made of laurel or elm, the socket of oak,
and the handle of ilex.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before mills were invented, the instrument by
which they reduced corn into flour was a large
mortar, scooped out of the trunk of a tree, furnished
with a pestle upwards of four feet in length,
exactly resembling that still in use among the Egyptian
Arabs. To give the pestle greater effect it was
fixed above in a cross-bar, seven feet long, and
worked by two individuals.<a id='r1687' /><a href='#f1687' class='c012'><sup>[1687]</sup></a> By this rude contrivance,
it is possible to produce flour as fine as that
proceeding from the most perfect boulting machine.
In addition to these they possessed winnowing fans,
scythes, sickles, pruning-hooks, fern or braken-scythes,
saws and hand-saws, used in pruning and grafting,
spades, shovels, rakes, pick-axes, hoes, mattocks,—one,
two, and three pronged,—dibbles, fork-dibbles, and
grubbing-axes.<a id='r1688' /><a href='#f1688' class='c012'><sup>[1688]</sup></a> When rustics were clearing away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>underwood or cutting down brakes, they went clad
in hooded skin-cloaks, leather gaiters, and long
gloves.<a id='r1689' /><a href='#f1689' class='c012'><sup>[1689]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the subject of manure<a id='r1690' /><a href='#f1690' class='c012'><sup>[1690]</sup></a> the Greeks appear
to have entertained very just notions, and have left
behind them numerous rules for using and preparing
it. In lean lands which required most the help
of art, they were still careful to avoid excess in
the employment of manure, spreading it frequently
rather than copiously; for as, left to themselves,
they would have been too cold, so, when over enriched
by art, their prolific virtue was thought to
be consumed by heat. In applying it to plants,
they were careful to interpose a layer of earth lest
their roots should be scorched. Of all kinds of manure
they considered that of birds the best,<a id='r1691' /><a href='#f1691' class='c012'><sup>[1691]</sup></a> except
the aquatic species, which, when mixed, however,
was not rejected. Most husbandmen set a peculiar
value on the sweepings of dovecotes,<a id='r1692' /><a href='#f1692' class='c012'><sup>[1692]</sup></a> which, in small
quantities, were frequently scattered over the fields
with the seed.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the preparation of manure-pits they bestowed
much attention.<a id='r1693' /><a href='#f1693' class='c012'><sup>[1693]</sup></a> Having sunk them sufficiently
deep in places abundantly supplied with water, they
cast therein large quantities of weeds, with all descriptions
of manure, among which they reckoned
even earth itself, when completely impregnated with
humidity. When they had lain long enough to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>entirely decayed, they were fit for use. To the above
were sometimes added wood-ashes, the refuse of
leather-dressers, the cleansing of stables, and cow-houses,
with stubble, brambles, and thorns reduced
to ashes. In maritime situations sea-weed,<a id='r1694' /><a href='#f1694' class='c012'><sup>[1694]</sup></a> also,
having been well washed in fresh water, was mingled
in large proportion with other materials, and,
where possible, a channel was made conducting
the muck and puddle<a id='r1695' /><a href='#f1695' class='c012'><sup>[1695]</sup></a> of the neighbouring road
into the pit, which at once accelerated the putrescence
of the manure and augmented it. The Attic
husbandmen had a mode of enriching their lands<a id='r1696' /><a href='#f1696' class='c012'><sup>[1696]</sup></a>
somewhat expensive, and, as far as I know, peculiar
to themselves; having sown a field, they allowed
the corn to spring up and the blade to reach a
considerable height, upon which they again ploughed
it in as a kind of sacrifice to the earth. A practice,
not altogether unlike, still prevails in the kingdom
of Naples, where the husbandmen sometimes bury
their beans and lupins, just before flowering, for manure.<a id='r1697' /><a href='#f1697' class='c012'><sup>[1697]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In ploughing there was great variety of practice,
and in small farms, where the soil was light, they
had recourse to what may be denominated spade
husbandry. Most lands were ploughed thrice; first,
immediately after the removal of the preceding crop;
secondly, at a convenient interval of time; and, thirdly,<a id='r1698' /><a href='#f1698' class='c012'><sup>[1698]</sup></a>
in the sowing season, when the ploughman scattered
the grain in the furrows as they were laid
open while a lad followed at his heels with a hoe
breaking the clods and covering the seed that it might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>not be devoured by the birds.<a id='r1699' /><a href='#f1699' class='c012'><sup>[1699]</sup></a> Occasionally, in very
hot weather, and in certain situations, the farmer
ploughed all night;<a id='r1700' /><a href='#f1700' class='c012'><sup>[1700]</sup></a> first, out of consideration to the
oxen, whose health would have suffered from the
sun; secondly, to preserve the moisture and richness
of the soil; and, thirdly, by the aid of the dew,
to render it more pliable. On these occasions, it
was customary to employ two pair of oxen and a
heavier share in order to produce the deeper furrows,
and turn up the hidden fat of the earth. In
choosing a ploughman they took care that he should
be tall and powerful,<a id='r1701' /><a href='#f1701' class='c012'><sup>[1701]</sup></a> that he might be able to
thrust the share deeper into the ground and wield
it generally with facility: and yet they would not,
if <a id='corr385.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='posssible'>possible</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_385.15'><ins class='correction' title='posssible'>possible</ins></a></span>, that he should be under forty years of
age, lest, instead of attending to his duties, his eye
should be glancing hither and thither, and his mind
be roving after his companions.<a id='r1702' /><a href='#f1702' class='c012'><sup>[1702]</sup></a> When in particular
haste to complete his task, the ploughman often
carried a long loaf under his arm, which, like the
French peasants, he ate as he went along.<a id='r1703' /><a href='#f1703' class='c012'><sup>[1703]</sup></a> In this
department of rural labour it may be observed, mules
were sometimes employed as well as oxen.<a id='r1704' /><a href='#f1704' class='c012'><sup>[1704]</sup></a> Both
were directed and kept in order by a sharp goad.<a id='r1705' /><a href='#f1705' class='c012'><sup>[1705]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the Greeks well understood the practice of fallowing,
their lands were then, as now, suffered to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>regain their strength by lying for a time idle;<a id='r1706' /><a href='#f1706' class='c012'><sup>[1706]</sup></a> and
it seems to have been as much their custom as it
is still of their descendants,<a id='r1707' /><a href='#f1707' class='c012'><sup>[1707]</sup></a> for the poor, at least,
to roam over these fallow grounds, collecting nettles,<a id='r1708' /><a href='#f1708' class='c012'><sup>[1708]</sup></a>
mallows, the sow-thistle or jagged lettuce,<a id='r1709' /><a href='#f1709' class='c012'><sup>[1709]</sup></a> dandelions,
sea-purslain, stoches, hartwort, briony sprouts,
gentle-rocket, usually found in the environs of towns,
and about the courts of houses, gardens, and ruins,
with other wild herbs for salads, or to be eaten as
vegetables.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rules observed in sowing were numerous, and,
in many instances, not a little curious. As a matter
of course, they were careful to adapt the grain to
the soil:<a id='r1710' /><a href='#f1710' class='c012'><sup>[1710]</sup></a> thus rich plains were appropriated to wheat,
and in the intervals cropped with vegetables; middling
grounds to barley;<a id='r1711' /><a href='#f1711' class='c012'><sup>[1711]</sup></a> while poor and hungry
spots were given up to lentils, vetches, lupins, and
such other pulse as were cultivated on a large scale.
Beans and peas, however, were supposed to thrive
best in fat and level lands. The principal sowing-time<a id='r1712' /><a href='#f1712' class='c012'><sup>[1712]</sup></a>
was in autumn; for, as soon as the equinoctial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>rains had moistened the earth, the sower
immediately went forth to sow, committing to the
ground the hopes of the future year. The best
time for scattering wheat they placed somewhere in
November, about the setting of the constellation
called the Crown. They were careful in this operation
to avoid the time when the south wind<a id='r1713' /><a href='#f1713' class='c012'><sup>[1713]</sup></a> blew,
and, generally, all cold and raw weather, as it rendered
the earth ungenial, and little apt to fructify
that which was entrusted to it. Great skill was
supposed to be required in scattering the seed: in
the first place, that it should be equally distributed;
and, secondly, that none should fall between the
horns of the oxen, superstition having taught them
the belief that such grain, which they denominated
Kerasbolos,<a id='r1714' /><a href='#f1714' class='c012'><sup>[1714]</sup></a> if it sprang up at all, would produce
corn which could neither be baked nor eaten. A
favourite sowing sieve was made of wolf’s-hide, pierced
with thirty holes as large as the tips of the fingers.
In later ages much virtue was supposed to reside
in the barbarous term Phriel,<a id='r1715' /><a href='#f1715' class='c012'><sup>[1715]</sup></a> which they accordingly
wrote on the plough. The choice of grains
for sowing necessarily afforded much exercise<a id='r1716' /><a href='#f1716' class='c012'><sup>[1716]</sup></a> to their
ingenuity: seed wheat, they thought, should be of
a rich gold colour, full, smooth, and solid; barley,
white and heavy; both not exceeding one year old,
for they quickly deteriorated, and, after the third
year, would not they supposed grow. This, however,
was an error, since barley has been known to preserve
its vitality upwards of two thousand years.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was customary often to renew seed by sowing
the produce of mountains on plains; of dry places
in moist, and the contrary.<a id='r1717' /><a href='#f1717' class='c012'><sup>[1717]</sup></a> To try the comparative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>value of different qualities of grain<a id='r1718' /><a href='#f1718' class='c012'><sup>[1718]</sup></a> they took
a sample of each, and sowed the whole in separate
patches of the same bed, a little before the rising
of the Dog-star. If the produce of any of these
samples withered, through the influence they supposed
of Syrius, the wheat which it represented was
rejected. As corn when committed to the earth is
exposed to numerous enemies, they had recourse to
a variety of contrivances for its preservation: to
protect it from birds, mice, and ants,<a id='r1719' /><a href='#f1719' class='c012'><sup>[1719]</sup></a> they steeped
it in the juice of houseleeks, or mixed it with hellebore
and cypress leaves, and scattered it out of a
circle, or sprinkled it with water into which river
crabs had been thrown for eight days, or with powdered
hartshorn or ivory. Not satisfied with these
precautions, they had likewise recourse to scarecrows,<a id='r1720' /><a href='#f1720' class='c012'><sup>[1720]</sup></a>
fixing up long reeds here and there in the
fields, with dead birds suspended to them by the
feet. This long list of contrivances they closed by
a spell: taking a live toad, they carried it round
the field by night, after which they shut it up carefully
in a jar, which they buried in the middle of
the grounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the corn began to spring up it was diligently
weeded<a id='r1721' /><a href='#f1721' class='c012'><sup>[1721]</sup></a> a first and a second time. They
would not trust entirely, however, to the industry of
their hands, but called in to their aid certain characteristic
enchantments, some two or three of which
may be worth describing. First, to subdue the
growth of choke-weed they planted sprigs of rose-laurel,
at the corner and in the middle of their
fields, or set up a number of potsherds, upon which
had been drawn with chalk the figure of Heracles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>strangling the lion. But the most effectual of
all spells, was for a young woman, naked and with
dishevelled hair, to take a live cock in her hands
and bear him round the fields, upon which, not only
would the choke-weed and the restharrow vanish,<a id='r1722' /><a href='#f1722' class='c012'><sup>[1722]</sup></a>
but all the produce of the land would turn out of
a superior quality.<a id='r1723' /><a href='#f1723' class='c012'><sup>[1723]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the ancients well understood the value of hay,
they took much pains in the formation and management
of meadows. In the first place, all stones,
stumps, bushes, and brambles,<a id='r1724' /><a href='#f1724' class='c012'><sup>[1724]</sup></a> were diligently removed,
together with whatever else might interrupt
the free play of the scythe in mowing. They avoided,
moreover, letting into them their droves of hogs,
which were found to turn up the soil and destroy
the roots of the young grass. In moist lands, too,
even the larger cattle were excluded, as the holes
made by their hoofs<a id='r1725' /><a href='#f1725' class='c012'><sup>[1725]</sup></a> in sinking broke up the fine
level of the turf. Old hay fields, in districts where
much rain fell, grew in time to be clothed with a
coating of moss,<a id='r1726' /><a href='#f1726' class='c012'><sup>[1726]</sup></a> which some farmers sought to remove
by manuring the ground with ashes; but the
more scientific agriculturists ploughed them up, and
took precisely the same steps as in the formation of
a new meadow, that is, they sowed the ground with
beans, turnips, or rape-seed, which, in the second year,
were succeeded by wheat; on the third it was thoroughly
cleared out, and sown with hay-seed, mingled
with vetches, after which the whole field was
finely levelled by the harrow.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rules observed by them in the regulation of
their hay harvest<a id='r1727' /><a href='#f1727' class='c012'><sup>[1727]</sup></a> were, first, to mow before the
grass or clover was withered, when it became less
rich and nutritive; second, to beware in making the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>ricks, that it was neither too dry nor too damp,
since in the former case it was little better than
straw, and in the latter was liable to spontaneous
combustion.<a id='r1728' /><a href='#f1728' class='c012'><sup>[1728]</sup></a> It may be observed further, that
clover<a id='r1729' /><a href='#f1729' class='c012'><sup>[1729]</sup></a> was usually sown in March or April, and
though commonly mown six, or at least five, times
in the twelve months, did not require to be renewed
in less than ten years.<a id='r1730' /><a href='#f1730' class='c012'><sup>[1730]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Harvest usually commenced in Greece about the
rising of the Pleiades,<a id='r1731' /><a href='#f1731' class='c012'><sup>[1731]</sup></a> when the corn had already
acquired a deep gold colour, though not yet so ripe
as to fall from the ear, which in barley happens
earlier than in wheat, the grain having no hose.<a id='r1732' /><a href='#f1732' class='c012'><sup>[1732]</sup></a>
Among the Romans operations were preceded by
the sacrifice<a id='r1733' /><a href='#f1733' class='c012'><sup>[1733]</sup></a> of a young sow to Ceres, with libations
of wine, the burning of frankincense, and the
offering of a cake to Jove, Juno, and Janus. They,
at the same time, addressed their prayers to the
last-mentioned gods, nearly in the following words:—“O
father Janus or Jupiter, in making an oblation
of this cake I offer up my prayers that thou
wouldst be propitious to me and my children, my
house, and my family!”<a id='r1734' /><a href='#f1734' class='c012'><sup>[1734]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At Athens, as soon as the season for reaping<a id='r1735' /><a href='#f1735' class='c012'><sup>[1735]</sup></a> had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>come round, those hardy citizens who lived by letting
out their strength for hire,<a id='r1736' /><a href='#f1736' class='c012'><sup>[1736]</sup></a> ranged themselves
in bands in the agora, whither the farmers of the
neighbourhood resorted in search of harvesters. They
then, in consequence of the hot weather, proceeded
half-naked<a id='r1737' /><a href='#f1737' class='c012'><sup>[1737]</sup></a> to the fields, where, taking the sickle in
hand, and separating into two divisions, they stationed
themselves at either end of the piece of corn to be
reaped, and began their work with vigour and emulation,
each party striving to reach the centre of
the field before their rivals.<a id='r1738' /><a href='#f1738' class='c012'><sup>[1738]</sup></a> On other occasions
they took advantage of the wind,<a id='r1739' /><a href='#f1739' class='c012'><sup>[1739]</sup></a> moving along with
it, whereby they were supposed to benefit considerably,
avoiding the beard or chaff which it might
have blown into their eyes, and having by its action
the tall straw bent to their hand.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>In many parts of Greece, though the practice was
not general, the women joined in these labours. The
reapers, as they advanced, laid the corn behind them
in long lines upon the stubble, and were followed
by two other classes of harvesters, one of whom
bound it into sheaves which the others bore back
and piled up into mows. Of the whole of these
operations, together with the plenteous feast which
interrupted or terminated their toils, Homer has
left us a graphic picture in the Iliad:<a id='r1740' /><a href='#f1740' class='c012'><sup>[1740]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There in a field ’mid lofty corn, the lusty reapers stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Plying their task right joyously, with sickle each in hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some strew in lines, as on they press, the handfuls thick behind,</div>
      <div class='line'>While at their heels the heavy sheaves their merry comrades bind.</div>
      <div class='line'>These to the mows a troop of boys next bear in haste away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Piling upon the golden glebe the triumphs of the day.</div>
      <div class='line'>Among them wrapped in silent joy, their sceptered king appears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beholding, in the swelling heaps, the stores of future years.</div>
      <div class='line'>A mighty ox beneath an oak the busy heralds slay,</div>
      <div class='line'>With grateful sacrifice to close the labours of the day.</div>
      <div class='line'>While near, the husbandman’s repast the rustic maids prepare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sprinkling with flour the broiling cates whose savour fills the air.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In these remote and unsettled times it behoved
the rustic to keep a sharp look-out on the sheaves
left behind him on the field, as there were usually
prowlers,<a id='r1741' /><a href='#f1741' class='c012'><sup>[1741]</sup></a> lurking amid the neighbouring woods and
thickets, ready to pounce upon and carry off whatever
they saw unguarded.</p>

<p class='c001'>The implement used in cutting wheat seems always
to have been the sickle, while in the case of barley
and other inferior grains, the scythe was commonly
employed. In some parts of ancient Gaul, where
no value was set upon the straw, corn was reaped
by a sort of cart,<a id='r1742' /><a href='#f1742' class='c012'><sup>[1742]</sup></a> armed in front with scythes,
having the edges inclined upwards, which, as it was
driven along by an ox, harnessed behind, cut off
the ears of corn, which were received into the tumbril.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>In this manner the produce of a whole field
might be got in easily in a day. Reaping among
the ancient inhabitants of Italy<a id='r1743' /><a href='#f1743' class='c012'><sup>[1743]</sup></a> was performed in
three ways: first they reaped close, as in Umbria,
and laid the handfuls carefully on the ground, after
which the ears were separated from the straw,
and borne in baskets to the threshing-floor. Elsewhere,
as in Picenum, they made use of a ripple
or serrated hook, having a long handle with
which the ears only were cut off, leaving the
straw standing to be afterwards collected and raked
up into mows.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the neighbourhood of Rome they reaped with
the common sickle, holding the upper part of the
straw in their left hand, and cutting it off in the
middle. This tall stubble was afterwards mown and
carried off to be used as fodder or bedding for cattle.
In Upper Egypt and Nubia, the dhoura stalks are
left about two feet in height to support the crop
of kidney-beans which succeeds next in order.
Among the Athenians<a id='r1744' /><a href='#f1744' class='c012'><sup>[1744]</sup></a> when the corn grew tall
the stubble was suffered to remain to be burned
for manure; but, when short, the value of the straw
led them to reap close.</p>

<p class='c001'>In separating the grain from the straw the ancients
made use of horses, oxen, and mules, which, passing
round and round over the threshing-floor, trod out
the corn. All the labourer had to do was to guide
the movements of the cattle, and take care that
no part of the sheaf remained untrodden.<a id='r1745' /><a href='#f1745' class='c012'><sup>[1745]</sup></a> From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>a very humane law in the Old Testament we
learn, that among some nations it was customary
to tie up the mouths of such animals as they employed
in this labour, which was forbidden the Israelites:
“Thou shalt not,” says the Scripture, “muzzle
the ox that treadeth out the corn.” Nor was
it practised among the Greeks in the age of Homer,<a id='r1746' /><a href='#f1746' class='c012'><sup>[1746]</sup></a>
whom we find describing the oxen bellowing as
they made their unwearied round. The threshing-floor,
which was of a circular form,<a id='r1747' /><a href='#f1747' class='c012'><sup>[1747]</sup></a> stood on a
breezy eminence, in the open field, where, as at
present, in modern Greece, and in the Crimea,<a id='r1748' /><a href='#f1748' class='c012'><sup>[1748]</sup></a> a
high pole was set up in the centre, to which the
cattle were tied by a cord determining the extent
of the circle they had to describe.<a id='r1749' /><a href='#f1749' class='c012'><sup>[1749]</sup></a> The end being
nailed, every turn made by the cattle coiled the
rope about the pole and diminished their range, until,
at length, they were brought quite close to the
centre, after which, their heads were turned about,
and by moving in an opposite direction the cord
was unwound. Great pains were taken in the construction
of this threshing-floor, which was somewhat
elevated about the centre, in order, as Varro
observes, that what rain fell might speedily run off.
It was sometimes paved with stone, or pitched with
flints, but more commonly coated with stucco, made
level by a roller, and well soaked with the lees of
oil which at once prevented the growth of weeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>and grass, preserved it from cracking, and repelled
the approach of mice, ants, and moles, to which oil-lees
are destructive.<a id='r1750' /><a href='#f1750' class='c012'><sup>[1750]</sup></a> Though some authorities advise
that it should be situated under the master’s,
or at least the steward’s, eye, it was generally
thought advisable to keep it at a distance from
the house and gardens, since the finer particles of
chaff, borne thickly through the air, caused ophthalmia,
and often blindness,<a id='r1751' /><a href='#f1751' class='c012'><sup>[1751]</sup></a> and proved exceedingly
injurious to all plants and pulpy fruits, more particularly
grapes. In some parts of the ancient
world, exposed to the chances of summer rains,
the threshing-floor was covered; and, even in Italy,
an umbracula,<a id='r1752' /><a href='#f1752' class='c012'><sup>[1752]</sup></a> or shed, was always constructed close
at hand, into which the corn could be removed in
case of bad weather. But this in the sunnier climate
of Greece was judged unnecessary. In obedience
to a notion prevalent among Hellenic farmers,
the sheaves were piled up with the straw towards
the south, by which means they believed the grain
was enlarged and loosened from the hose. When
the farmer happened to be scant of cattle he made
use of a threshing-machine,<a id='r1753' /><a href='#f1753' class='c012'><sup>[1753]</sup></a> which consisted of a
kind of heavy sledge, toothed below with sharp
stones or iron. Occasionally, too, the flail<a id='r1754' /><a href='#f1754' class='c012'><sup>[1754]</sup></a> was
used, especially in the case of such corn as was
laid up in the barn and threshed during winter.</p>

<p class='c001'>In winnowing,<a id='r1755' /><a href='#f1755' class='c012'><sup>[1755]</sup></a> when the breeze served, they simply
threw the grain up into the air with a scoop,
until the wind had completely cleared away the chaff.
In serene days they had recourse to a winnowing
machine, which, though turned by the hand, was of
great power, as we may judge from its being employed
in cleansing vetches, and even beans.<a id='r1756' /><a href='#f1756' class='c012'><sup>[1756]</sup></a> To receive
the chaff, which was too valuable to be lost, pits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>appear to have been sunk all round the threshing-floor,
which, for the passage of the men and cattle,
would appear to have been covered, save in the
direction of the wind.<a id='r1757' /><a href='#f1757' class='c012'><sup>[1757]</sup></a> When the corn was designed
for immediate use, one winnowing was deemed sufficient;
but that which was intended to be laid up
in the granary<a id='r1758' /><a href='#f1758' class='c012'><sup>[1758]</sup></a> underwent the operation a second
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the building and preparation of granaries<a id='r1759' /><a href='#f1759' class='c012'><sup>[1759]</sup></a> the
ancients bestowed great pains. Every means which
could communicate to grain firmness and durability
appears to have been tried by them; and their success
was answerable to their diligence, for, in their
granaries, wheat was preserved in perfection fifty,
and millet a hundred years.<a id='r1760' /><a href='#f1760' class='c012'><sup>[1760]</sup></a> Their methods, however,
were various; some laid up their grain in hollow
rocks and caves, as in Thrace and Cappadocia;
others sank deep pits in the earth<a id='r1761' /><a href='#f1761' class='c012'><sup>[1761]</sup></a> where they found
it to be perfectly free from humidity, as in Farther
Spain, while others, as in Hither Spain, Apulia, and
Greece,<a id='r1762' /><a href='#f1762' class='c012'><sup>[1762]</sup></a> erected their granaries on lofty basements
fronting the East, and with openings towards the
north and west winds.<a id='r1763' /><a href='#f1763' class='c012'><sup>[1763]</sup></a> There was usually a range of
numerous diminutive windows near the roof, to supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>free vent for the heated air, while the floor, in many
cases, contained small apertures for the admission of
the cool breezes beneath. The walls were built with
suitable solidity, and having, together with the floor,
been plastered with rough mortar,<a id='r1764' /><a href='#f1764' class='c012'><sup>[1764]</sup></a> made commonly
with hair, for which chaff was sometimes substituted,
received a coat of fine stucco, on the preparation
of which much care was bestowed. It was generally
composed of lime, sand, and powdered marble, moistened
with the lees of oil, the peculiar flavour and
odour of which were supposed effectually to repel
the approaches of mice,<a id='r1765' /><a href='#f1765' class='c012'><sup>[1765]</sup></a> weevils, and ants. Instead
of this a common stucco, formed of clay, was often
used. Occasionally the grain was packed up in baskets
or large jars,<a id='r1766' /><a href='#f1766' class='c012'><sup>[1766]</sup></a> such, it may be presumed, as those
still employed for the purpose in Africa, where they
are commonly kept in a corner outside the door.
Beans and other pulse were preserved in oil-jars
rubbed with ashes.<a id='r1767' /><a href='#f1767' class='c012'><sup>[1767]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Before the produce of the new year was carried
in, the granaries, having been carefully swept, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>smeared all over with oil-lees. Various other precautions
were, likewise, taken to protect the sacred
gifts of Demeter from depredation, such as drawing
on the floor broad lines of chalk,<a id='r1768' /><a href='#f1768' class='c012'><sup>[1768]</sup></a> or strewing handfuls
of wild origany round the heaps, or sprinkling
them with the ashes of oaken twigs or dry cow’s
dung, or sprigs of wormwood and southernwood, or,
in greater quantity, the leaves of the everlasting.
Instead of these, in some cases, they made use of
powdered clay<a id='r1769' /><a href='#f1769' class='c012'><sup>[1769]</sup></a> or dry pomegranate leaves, rubbed
small, and passed through a sieve, a chœnix of which
was sprinkled over a bushel of corn. The favourite
plan, however, seems to have been, to spread a layer
of half-withered fleabane over the floor, on which
were poured about ten bushels of wheat, then a layer
of fleabane, and so on, until the granary was full.<a id='r1770' /><a href='#f1770' class='c012'><sup>[1770]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>Wheat thus layed up was supposed not only to last
many years, but also to preserve its weight in breadmaking.
To render barley durable, they strewed over
it laurel leaves, or the ashes of laurel wood, as, likewise,
everlasting, calaminth, and gypsum, or placed
a tightly-corked bottle of vinegar,<a id='r1771' /><a href='#f1771' class='c012'><sup>[1771]</sup></a> in the middle of
the heap. To communicate greater plumpness to
all kinds of grain, they sprinkled over the piles a
mixture composed of nitre,<a id='r1772' /><a href='#f1772' class='c012'><sup>[1772]</sup></a> spume of nitre, and fine
earth, which, likewise, acted as a preservative. To
render flour more durable, they thrust into it small
maple branches, stripped of their leaves, or little
cakes of salt and cumin.<a id='r1773' /><a href='#f1773' class='c012'><sup>[1773]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The fruits of the earth having been thus safely
lodged within doors, the grateful husbandmen celebrated
in honour of their rural gods, Demeter and
Dionysos, a festival which may, perhaps, be denominated
that of the Harvest Home. In Attica it took
place in the great temple at Eleusis, and continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>during several days. No bloody sacrifices were on this
occasion offered up; but, in lieu of them, oblations
of cakes and fruit with other rustic offerings, designed
at once to express their gratitude for past blessings,
and to render the gods propitious to them in future.
The first loaf made from the new corn was probably
eaten or offered up on this day, since it received
the name of Thargelos, or Thalusios, from Thalusia,
the denomination of the festival.<a id='r1774' /><a href='#f1774' class='c012'><sup>[1774]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Before we quit the farm, it may be observed,
that the ancients kept a number of slaves, constituting
a kind of rural police, whose occupation
wholly consisted in guarding the boundaries of estates.<a id='r1775' /><a href='#f1775' class='c012'><sup>[1775]</sup></a>
These, among the Romans, were denominated rangers,
or foresters. There were others to whom the care
of the fruit was entrusted; and both these classes of
persons were probably elderly men, remarkable for
their diligence and fidelity, who were rewarded, by
appointment to this more easy duty, for their honest
discharge in youth of such as were more painful and
laborious. Boys were sometimes set to keep watch
over vineyards,<a id='r1776' /><a href='#f1776' class='c012'><sup>[1776]</sup></a> as we may see in the first Eidyll of
Theocritus, where he gives us a lively sketch of such
a guardian plotted against by two foxes.</p>

by Della Rocca:—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Les granges,
appelées en Grec θεμονέα, ont
communément une vingtaine
de pieds de long, sur huit à dix
de hauteur et de largeur. On
les remplit jusqu’à la moitié

de trois ou quatre pieds, que
l’on remplit de grain. A côté
on en forme un autre, que l’on
remplit de même, et ainsi de
suite, selon l’étendue de la
grange, et la quantité de grain
que l’on a; cela fait, par des
ouvertures pratiquées dans la
couverture, on recouvre de paille
tout le bled, jusqu’à ce que la
grange soit exactement remplie.
Quand on veut en faire usage,
on commence par le tas le plus
voisin de la porte; on enlève
d’abord la paille avec beaucoup
de précaution: plus on
approche, plus cette précaution
augmente; enfin, pour ôter les
derniers brins de paille, on se
sert d’un balai de millepertuis
ou d’autres plantes que
l’on fait sécher; et si malgré
tous ces soins, la surface du
monceau de grain n’est pas bien
nette, on achève d’en enlever
toutes les menues pailles en
la vannant avec un chapeau
car les paysans de nos îles portent

des chapeaux ronds de feutre;
ils en portent aussi de paille,

Traité Complet sur les Abeilles.</span>
t. i. p. 199, seq. Among the tribes
of Northern Africa a more complete
system of preserving grain
prevails. “The Arabs, in lieu
of granaries, preserve all their
grain in pits: forty or fifty of
these are made, each to contain
about a thousand bushels:
the spot selected is a dry,
sandy soil, the hole being formed
in the shape of a large earthen
jug, the sides are plastered
with mortar about a foot in
thickness, and the wheat or
grain filled up to the mouth,
which is left just large enough
for a man to get in at, and
is about three feet below the
surface of the ground; this
is now plastered over also, and
filled with the soil around
to the same level as the surrounding
country. The earth
taken out in forming the pits
is removed to a distance, and
being scattered abroad, in a
month or two the grass grows
over the surface, and no one,
unless those who have buried
this treasure, would imagine
that there was anything beneath
their feet. The grain
thus buried preserves for many
years. I have eaten bread at
the Esmailla made from wheat
as old as the Sultan, having
been buried the year of his
birth, and it was as good as
that made of flour from this
year’s crop.” Colonel Scott,

Esmailla of Abd-el-Kader. p. 155,
seq. Mandelslo (lib. ii. c. iii.) found
corn-vaults of similar construction

of a bottle in the solid rock.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> PASTORAL LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But within the circle of Hellenic country life<a id='r1777' /><a href='#f1777' class='c012'><sup>[1777]</sup></a>
there was a kind of parenthetical existence, a
remnant of the old nomadic habits, once common,
perhaps, to the whole race,—I mean the pastoral
life, of which we obtain so many glimpses
through the leafy glades and grassy avenues of Greek
poetry. No doubt, the fancy of imaginative men,
thirsting for a degree of simplicity and happiness
greater than they find around them in cities or
villages, is apt to kindle and shed too glorious a
light on approaching the tranquil solitudes, the pine
forests, the mountain glens, the hidden lakes, the
umbrageous streams that leap and frolic down the
wild rocks of a country so rife with beauty as Greece.
Nevertheless, adhering strictly to truth and reality,
there is, in such regions, much about the pastoral
life to delight the mind. In the first place, the
occupations of an ancient shepherd left him great
leisure, and he was generally, by habit no less than
by inclination, led to prize that “dolce far niente”
which, in all southern climates, constitutes the chief
enjoyment of existence.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>And indeed all the world over, repose, both of
mind and body, is sweet. But not entire repose.
Accordingly the Grecian shepherd, whose flocks fed
tranquilly, whose condition, assured, and pinched by
no necessities, left him at liberty to consult his own
tastes in his recreations, took refuge from idleness
in music and song.<a id='r1778' /><a href='#f1778' class='c012'><sup>[1778]</sup></a> At first, and perhaps always,
their lays were rude; but nature, their only teacher,
infused into them originality and passion, such as
we find in the only poet of antiquity, save Homer,
in whose verses the fragrance of the woods still
breathes. Whether like Paris and Anchises they
kept their own flocks or undertook the care for
others, they were still on the mountains perfectly
free. Their education was peculiar. Abroad much
after dark,<a id='r1779' /><a href='#f1779' class='c012'><sup>[1779]</sup></a> in a climate where the summer nights
are soft and balmy beyond expression, and where
the stars seem lovingly to crowd closer about the
earth, they necessarily grew romantic and superstitious.<a id='r1780' /><a href='#f1780' class='c012'><sup>[1780]</sup></a>
Events occurring early in their own lives or
handed down to them by tradition, long meditated
on, were in the end invested with supernatural attributes.
Under similar circumstances their national
religion had probably been first formed. They in
the same way, in every canton, created a local religion.<a id='r1781' /><a href='#f1781' class='c012'><sup>[1781]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Their very creed was poetry. Tree, rock,
mountain, spring, every thing was instinct with divinity,
not mystically, as in certain philosophical
systems, but literally; and, as they believed, the immortal
race, their invisible companions at all hours,
could when they pleased put on visibility, or rather
remove from their eyes the film which prevented
their habitually beholding them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is well known that, in the present day, among
the nomadic nations of Asia, the sons of the chiefs
still follow their flocks in the wilderness. And this
in the heroic ages was likewise the case in Greece,<a id='r1782' /><a href='#f1782' class='c012'><sup>[1782]</sup></a>
where youths of the noblest families watched over
their fathers’ sheep and cattle. Thus Bucolion, son
of Laomedon, led to pasture the flocks of his sire,
and, in the solitudes of the Phrygian mountains, was
met and loved by a nymph.<a id='r1783' /><a href='#f1783' class='c012'><sup>[1783]</sup></a> Two sons also of
Priam pursued the same occupation;<a id='r1784' /><a href='#f1784' class='c012'><sup>[1784]</sup></a> and thus
among the Hebrews, David, the son of Jesse, passes
his youth in the sheepfold, and his manhood on a
throne. In this secluded and solitary life the sights
and sounds of nature became familiar to them, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>voice of sudden torrents rushing from the mountains,<a id='r1785' /><a href='#f1785' class='c012'><sup>[1785]</sup></a>
the roar of lions springing on their folds, or the sweet
moonlight silvering both mountain and valley. It
is with the shepherd’s life that Homer connects
that noble description of the night which Chapman
has thus translated:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As when about the silver moon, when air is free from wind,<a id='r1786' /><a href='#f1786' class='c012'><sup>[1786]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>And stars shine clear,<a id='r1787' /><a href='#f1787' class='c012'><sup>[1787]</sup></a> to whose sweet beams high prospects and the brows</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all steep hills and pinnacles thrust up themselves for shows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And even the lonely valleys joy to glitter in their sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the unmeasured firmament bursts to disclose her light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the signs in heaven are seen, that glad the shepherd’s heart.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The glimpses of pastoral life, albeit too few, are
still frequent in Homer, who loves, whenever possible,
to illustrate his subject by bringing before our
minds the image of a shepherd. Thus Hector, lifting
a large rock, is compared to a shepherd bearing
a ram’s fleece.<a id='r1788' /><a href='#f1788' class='c012'><sup>[1788]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As when the fleece, though large yet light, the careful shepherd rears,</div>
      <div class='line'>With both hands plunged within its folds, so he the rock uptears.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Again, the Trojan forces following their leader,
Æneas, suggest to his mind the idea of innumerable
flocks bounding after a ram to drink.<a id='r1789' /><a href='#f1789' class='c012'><sup>[1789]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

to overlook the rest.<a id='r1792' /><a href='#f1792' class='c012'><sup>[1792]</sup></a> Among the ancients
twenty sheep were thought to require the attention
of a man and a boy;<a id='r1793' /><a href='#f1793' class='c012'><sup>[1793]</sup></a> but, in modern times, three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>men and a boy, with four or five dogs, are sometimes
entrusted with a flock of five hundred, of
which two-thirds are ewes.<a id='r1794' /><a href='#f1794' class='c012'><sup>[1794]</sup></a> The proportion of rams
to ewes is at present as four to a hundred.</p>

<p class='c001'>From very remote ages shepherds had learned
to avail themselves of the aid of dogs,<a id='r1795' /><a href='#f1795' class='c012'><sup>[1795]</sup></a> which in
farms were usually furnished with wooden collars.<a id='r1796' /><a href='#f1796' class='c012'><sup>[1796]</sup></a>
The breed generally employed in this service, in
later ages at least, was the Molossian,<a id='r1797' /><a href='#f1797' class='c012'><sup>[1797]</sup></a> which, though
exceedingly powerful and fierce towards strangers,
was by its masters found sufficiently gentle and
tractable. The shepherd’s pipe,<a id='r1798' /><a href='#f1798' class='c012'><sup>[1798]</sup></a> frequently made
of the donax, or common river-reed,<a id='r1799' /><a href='#f1799' class='c012'><sup>[1799]</sup></a> likewise used
in thatching cottages, formed a no less necessary
accompaniment. Another of their instruments of
music was the flute crooked at the top, finely polished
and rubbed with bees’ wax.<a id='r1800' /><a href='#f1800' class='c012'><sup>[1800]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the Arcadians, descendants of the Pelasgians,
derived one of their principal delights from music,<a id='r1801' /><a href='#f1801' class='c012'><sup>[1801]</sup></a>
it is reasonable to infer that the ancestral nation,
preëminently pastoral, was likewise addicted to this
science. The feeding of herds and flocks constituted
the principal occupation of the Proselenoi,<a id='r1802' /><a href='#f1802' class='c012'><sup>[1802]</sup></a>
who were little devoted to agriculture, as may be
inferred from their acorn-eating habits; for no nation
ever continued to feed on mast after they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>could obtain bread. A report prevailed in the ancient
world that the Arcadians were of a poetical
temperament, to which Virgil alludes in the well-known
verses—</p>

<p class='c015'>And as improvisatori they may possibly have excelled,
though Greece knew nothing of an Arcadian
literature. However, chiefly after the example
of Virgil, the poets of modern times have always
delighted to convert Arcadia into a kind of pastoral
Utopia, which is done by Sannazaro, Tasso,
Guarini, Sir Philip Sydney, Daniel, and many others.
Palmerius à Grentmesnil<a id='r1803' /><a href='#f1803' class='c012'><sup>[1803]</sup></a> discovers something like
the descendants of the Arcadians among the Irish,

insignia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their usual clothing consisted of diptheræ, or
dressed sheepskins,<a id='r1804' /><a href='#f1804' class='c012'><sup>[1804]</sup></a> just as at the present day
among the Nubian shepherds, whom one may see
thus clad, roaming through the sandy hollows of
the Lybian desert. On the inside of these skins
the traitor Hermion wrote the letters which betrayed
the designs of his countrymen to the enemy in Laconia.<a id='r1805' /><a href='#f1805' class='c012'><sup>[1805]</sup></a>

<p class='c014'>And thus simple was ever their appearance in
the East. But, as I have hinted above, their very
great leisure,<a id='r1808' /><a href='#f1808' class='c012'><sup>[1808]</sup></a> the accidents of their occupation, and
the grand and regular march of natural phenomena
in those countries, often ripened their intellects beyond
what the condition of a modern heath-trotter
renders credible. Thus, in the mountains of Chaldæa,
astronomy and all its parasitical sciences took
birth among the shepherd race. From temperament
and circumstances, the inhabitants of thinly-peopled
tracts, if unvexed by wars, are profoundly meditative.
What they behold in serene indistraction
gradually rouses their thoughts, and presenting itself
again and again, attended always, as the phenomena
of the heavens are, by the same accidents, compels
them to study.<a id='r1809' /><a href='#f1809' class='c012'><sup>[1809]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>But solitude is less surely the nurse of science
than of superstition. The leaven, which in populous
cities scarcely swells visibly in the breast, ferments
unrestrainedly in the depths of woods, in the
high-piled recesses of mountains, in the gloom of
caverns, where nature invests itself with attributes
which address themselves powerfully to the heart,
and appears almost to hold communion with its
offspring. Hence the wild mythologies of Nomadic
races, which are not loose-hanging creeds, to be put
off and on like a cloak, but a belief inwrought
into their souls, a part of themselves, and perhaps
the best part, since it is from this that springs the
whole dignity and poetry of their lives. In all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>countries fables rise in the fields, to flow into and
be lost in the cities. Observe the wild picture
which Plato, in his Academic Dream, presents to
us of a group of Lydian shepherds. It has all the
poetical elements of an Arabian tale.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tradition, he says, represented Gyges the ancestor
of Crœsus as a hired shepherd, who with many
others guarded the imperial flocks in the remoter
districts of the country. At this time happened a
great earthquake, attended by floods of rain, which,
in the parts where they were, opened up a vast
chasm in the earth. Gyges arriving alone at the
mouth of the gap stood amazed at its depth and
magnitude, but observing a practicable descent went
down, and roamed through its subterraneous passages.
Many marvellous things, according to the
mythos, did he there see, and among the rest a
hollow brazen horse, with doors in its side, through
which looking in, he beheld a colossal naked corpse,
with a jewelled ring on its hand. Transferring this
to his own finger Gyges departed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shortly afterwards, still wearing the signet, he
went to the assembly of shepherds, which met
monthly, for the purpose of selecting a person to
bear the usual report of the flocks to the king.
Sitting down among the rest he happened to turn
the beavil of his ring towards himself, upon which
he became invisible to his companions,<a id='r1810' /><a href='#f1810' class='c012'><sup>[1810]</sup></a> as he clearly
discovered from their discourse, which proceeded as
if about an absent man. Smitten with much wonder
he returned the gem to its former position and
again became visible. He made the experiment
over and over and always with success; upon which,
like another Macbeth, a vast scheme of ambition
darkly shadowed itself upon his mind, and a crown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>tinged slightly with blood swam before him. It
does not, however, appear that like the Thane of
Cawdor he was perplexed with scruples. He does
not say,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why do I yield to that suggestion,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the use of nature? Present facts</div>
      <div class='line'>Are less than horrible imaginings.</div>
      <div class='line'>My thought whose murder’s yet but phantasy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shakes so my single state of man, that function</div>
      <div class='line'>Is smothered in surmise, and nothing is,</div>
      <div class='line'>But what is not.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Gyges, with the ruthless resolution of an Oriental,
forms his plan at once, and coolly works it out.
He procures himself to be elected one of the mission
to the king, and on arriving at the capital,
dishonours the queen, murders his master, and ascends
the throne.<a id='r1811' /><a href='#f1811' class='c012'><sup>[1811]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This may be regarded as a specimen of the shepherds’
tales.<a id='r1812' /><a href='#f1812' class='c012'><sup>[1812]</sup></a> But they moved for the most part in
an atmosphere of superstition, had ceremonies of
their own, a mythology of their own, and of the
whole the pervading spirit was love. In communities
highly civilised, this passion commonly degenerates
into a plaything, despised when weak, and
mischievous when strong. It is otherwise in the
early stages of society. There, in proportion to
their freedom from the aspirations and anxieties of
ambition, men seek happiness in the cultivation of
the affections. The society of women is to them
all in all. And the evils that infest them, disturb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>their quiet, and engender crime, spring, too, from
the same bitter-sweet fountain, which flows with
honey or gall according to the temper of those who
drink of it. Consequently, in contemplating the
pastoral life of Greece, we must beware not to
overlook the shepherdesses,<a id='r1813' /><a href='#f1813' class='c012'><sup>[1813]</sup></a> those heroines of Bucolic
poetry, whose freshness and nature still survive
in Theocritus, and other fragments of antiquity,
and may operate as an antidote to that insipid
spawn whose loves and lamentations affect us
like ipecacuanha in modern pastorals.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these latitudes of society, at least, women enjoyed
their freedom, and the glimpses presented to
us of them as they there existed may be regarded
among the chief charms of Greek poetry. Only,
for example, observe the picture which Chæremon
the Flower Poet, has delineated of a bevy of beautiful
virgins sporting by moonlight:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There one reclined apart I saw, within the moon’s pale light,</div>
      <div class='line'>With bosom through her parted robe appearing snowy white;</div>
      <div class='line'>Another danced, and floating free her garments in the breeze</div>
      <div class='line'>She seemed as buoyant as the wave that leaps o’er summer seas.</div>
      <div class='line'>While dusky shadows all around shrunk backward from the place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chased by the beaming splendour shed like sunshine from her face:</div>
      <div class='line'>Beside this living picture stood a maiden passing fair</div>
      <div class='line'>With soft round arms exposed; a fourth with free and graceful air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Dian when the bounding hart she tracks through morning dew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bared through the opening of her robes her lovely limbs to view.</div>
      <div class='line'>And oh! the image of her charms, as clouds in heaven above,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mirrored by streams, left on my soul the stamp of hopeless love.</div>
      <div class='line'>And slumbering near them others lay, on beds of sweetest flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dusky petaled violet, the rose of Paphian bowers.</div>
      <div class='line'>The inula and saffron flower, which on their garments cast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And veils, such hues as deck the sky when day is ebbing fast;</div>
      <div class='line'>While far and near tall marjoram bedecked the fairy ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loading with sweets the vagrant winds that frolicked all around.”<a id='r1814' /><a href='#f1814' class='c012'><sup>[1814]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In the ordinary bucolic poets women to be sure
are sketched with a rude pencil, though coquettish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>as queens, of which we have an exemplification in
the picture on the shepherd’s cup:<a id='r1815' /><a href='#f1815' class='c012'><sup>[1815]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And there, by ivy shaded, sits a maid divinely wrought,</div>
      <div class='line'>With veil and circlet on her brows, by two fond lovers sought.</div>
      <div class='line'>Both beautiful with flowing hair, both sueing to be heard,</div>
      <div class='line'>On this side one, the other there, but neither is preferred.</div>
      <div class='line'>For now on this, on that anon, she pours her witching smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like sunshine on the buds of hope, in falsehood all and guile,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though ceaselessly, with swelling eyes, they seek her heart to move,</div>
      <div class='line'>By every soft and touching art that wins a maiden’s love.<a id='r1816' /><a href='#f1816' class='c012'><sup>[1816]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There is here no straining after the ideal. Like
Titian’s beauties, these shepherdesses are all creatures
of this earth, filled with robust health, dark-eyed,
warm, impassioned, and somewhat deficient in
reserve. They understand well how to act their
part in a dialogue. For every bolt shot at them
they can return another as keen. Each bower and
bosky bourne seems redolent of their smiles; their
laughter awakens the echoes; their ruddy lips and
pearly teeth hang like a vision over every bubbling
spring and love-hiding thicket which they were wont
to frequent. Hence the charm of Theocritus. And
a still stronger charm perhaps would have belonged
to the pages of him who should have painted the
shepherd’s life of a remoter age,<a id='r1817' /><a href='#f1817' class='c012'><sup>[1817]</sup></a> when none were
above such an occupation, which therefore united
at once all the dignity of lofty independence with
the careless freedom of manners and unapprehensive
enjoyment in which consists the secret source of all
the pleasure which rustic pictures afford. Most of
his creations, though not all, are in this respect wanting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>Ideas of penury<a id='r1818' /><a href='#f1818' class='c012'><sup>[1818]</sup></a> slip in, and, in the midst of
rich poetry, check the developement of pleasurable
feelings. For the musical swains, though apparently
ambitious of nought but the reputation of song, permit
us to discover, that they are but hirelings tending
flocks not their own. The contrast between persons
of this class and those who are owners of the sheep
they tend, is forcibly pointed out in the sacred language
of Christ: “I am the good shepherd: the
good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But
he that is an hireling and not the shepherd and
whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf
coming, and leaveth the sheep and fleeth, and
the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep.
The hireling fleeth because he is a hireling, and
careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd
and know my sheep and am known of mine.
As the Father knoweth me even so know I the
Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.”<a id='r1819' /><a href='#f1819' class='c012'><sup>[1819]</sup></a>
The same affectionate tenderness is attributed to
shepherds in the prophetic writings: “he shall feed
his flocks like a shepherd, he shall gather the
lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom,
and shall gently lead those that are with young.”<a id='r1820' /><a href='#f1820' class='c012'><sup>[1820]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the matter of virtues and vices, the shepherds
of antiquity were very much, no doubt, like other
men. Their habits were such as grew naturally out
of their position. Towards whatever their feelings led
them they proceeded vehemently, and with that singleness
of purpose which belongs to men of simple
and decided character.<a id='r1821' /><a href='#f1821' class='c012'><sup>[1821]</sup></a> They were too commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>creatures of mere impulse. From the peculiar form of
their communion with nature, which, like the masses
of Egyptian architecture, was continued and monotonous,
they acquired a peculiarity of mental temperament,
warm, as it were, in parts, and cold in
parts. Every circumstance around them tended to
rouse, pique, and inflame the passion of desire and
its concomitants; the pairing of their flocks, of
the birds, of the very wild beasts whose courage or
ferocity they dreaded; their own leisure combined
with the excess of health, the influence of climate,
the solicitations of opportunity, impelled them into
excess; and, accordingly, their morals in this respect
sank to a low standard, and rendered them any
thing but models of the golden age. The intellect
of course was comparatively little cultivated; and
there being no other check upon the feelings, suicides,
murders of jealousy, and other evidences of
ill-regulated passion would often occur.<a id='r1822' /><a href='#f1822' class='c012'><sup>[1822]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But, in proportion as we pierce further back into
antiquity, these tragical incidents become fewer: not
merely because our knowledge of those ages is more
scanty, but that in ruder times morality is comparatively
lax, and men’s taste less fastidious. The
rigid laws of marriage were then little observed.
Women passed from husband to husband without
losing character or caste; and when they produced
illegitimate offspring attributed the paternity to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>god, and scarcely considered the circumstance a misfortune.
Half the princes of the Homeric age were
illegitimate; for this is what is always meant by
saying they were descended from the gods. Æneas
was the son of some young woman whom Anchises
met on the mountains, where he pastured his father’s
flocks and pretended to have been loved by
Aphrodite.<a id='r1823' /><a href='#f1823' class='c012'><sup>[1823]</sup></a> Persons so circumstanced were, doubtless,
capable of much romance. Nymphs and goddesses
peopled their imagination, and their imagination
let loose its brood upon the woods. Poets
afterwards, able to infuse a soul into these rustic
traditions, gave a local habitation and a name to
every beautiful legend they could collect. Hence
that sunny picture, the interview of Aphrodite and
Anchises amid the lofty recesses, the grassy slopes,
the sparkling leaping brooks, and old umbrageous
forests of Mount Ida. Already, however, the force
of dress was known, which Montaigne afterwards
celebrated; for the Homeric bard, about to record
an interview between the goddess and her shepherd-lover,
instead of supposing her to have been</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When unadorned, adorned the most,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>describes all the arts of a luxurious toilette.</p>

<p class='c001'>The picture, however, of pastoral life which he
suggests rather than describes, is worked out with
strokes of great simplicity. All the other herdsmen
disperse in the execution of their several duties,
leaving Anchises alone in the cattle-sheds,<a id='r1824' /><a href='#f1824' class='c012'><sup>[1824]</sup></a>
spacious in dimensions, and tastefully erected, where
he amuses his solitary leisure with the music of the
cithara. While thus engaged he beholds the approach
of the goddess,<a id='r1825' /><a href='#f1825' class='c012'><sup>[1825]</sup></a> and is at once struck with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>her beauty and the splendour of her raiment. At
the unearthly vision his love is kindled; but the
poet, skilled in the mysteries of the heart, chastens
his passion by overmastering feelings of reverence,
such as necessarily belong to unsophisticated youth.
Anchises constitutes, indeed, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>beau idéal</i></span> of an
heroic shepherd, simple, high-minded, ingenuous,
venturous and fearless in contests with man or
beast, but in his intercourse with woman gentle, reverent,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And of his port as meek as is a maid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In fact, the gallant knights of romance seem rather
to have been modelled after the heroic warriors of
Greece, than from any realities supplied by the chivalrous
ages. The author of the Hymn is careful
in describing the shepherd’s couch, to insinuate with
how great strength and courage he was endowed.
He reclines, we are told, on skins of bears and
lions slain by his own hand, though over these
there were cast, for show, garments of the softest
texture.<a id='r1826' /><a href='#f1826' class='c012'><sup>[1826]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Throughout this work it has been seen how the influence
of climate and position concurred in the formation
of the Greek character. We may ourselves
put the doctrine to the proof by observing the effect
upon our minds of those reflections of landscapes which
appear in language; rude Boreal scenes exciting the
spirit of contention and energy; while the soft valleys,
groves, and odoriferous gardens of the South
produce a calm upon our thoughts favourable to the
more benevolent emotions. Hellenic shepherds,
therefore, no other causes preventing, may upon
the whole be supposed to have been humane.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>Indeed, the very curious adventures of a sophist,<a id='r1827' /><a href='#f1827' class='c012'><sup>[1827]</sup></a>
in the mountains of Eubœa, preserved among the
literary wrecks of antiquity, open up to our view
a picture of pastoral life which, in spite of much
rudeness and indigence, exhibits the Greek character
in its original roughness and simplicity, full of
kindness, full of gentleness, full of hospitable propensities,
which would do honour to the noblest
Arab Sheikh. And the material scene itself, in
every feature Grecian, harmonises exactly with the
moral landscape.</p>

<p class='c001'>The eastern shores of the island of Negropont,
beetled over by Mount Caphareus,<a id='r1828' /><a href='#f1828' class='c012'><sup>[1828]</sup></a> and indented by
no creeks or harbours, were in antiquity infamous
for shipwrecks, notwithstanding that they formed
the principal station of the purple fishers.<a id='r1829' /><a href='#f1829' class='c012'><sup>[1829]</sup></a> Cast
away on this coast, the sophist Dion, for his eloquence
surnamed of the golden-mouth, fell in with
a pastoral hunter who, entertaining him generously,
furnished at the same time a complete idea of the
rude herdsman, who preserved in the vicinity of the
highest civilisation known to the old world the simplicity
of the Homeric Abantes.<a id='r1830' /><a href='#f1830' class='c012'><sup>[1830]</sup></a> Nay, this wild
sportsman, pursuing with his huge dogs a stag along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>the cliffs, powerful in limb, hale in colour, and with
long hair streaming over his shoulders, appeared to
be the natural descendant of those Heroic warriors.<a id='r1831' /><a href='#f1831' class='c012'><sup>[1831]</sup></a>
Armed with his hunting-knife, he flays and cuts up
the stag upon the spot, and taking along with him
the skin and choicest pieces of venison abandons the
remainder on the beach. As they go along he displays
the knowledge wherewith experience stores
the rustic mind. He understands the signs of the
weather, and from the clouds which cap the summits
of Caphareus foretells how long the sea will
continue unnavigable.<a id='r1832' /><a href='#f1832' class='c012'><sup>[1832]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Rude as an American backwoodsman, he was precipitated,
by the rare luck of meeting with a stranger,
into equal inquisitiveness and garrulity. He put
questions without waiting for an answer. He gossipped
of his own concerns; explained without being
asked the whole economy of his life; and exhibited
all that enthusiasm of beneficence which belongs to
human nature when uncorrupted by the thirst of
gold. There is a rare truth in the description; far
too much ever to have graced a sophist’s tale, unless
nature had supplied the model.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are two of us,” says he, “who inhabit together
the same rude nook, having married sisters,
by whom we have both sons and daughters. We
derive our subsistence principally from the chase,
paying but little attention to agriculture, since we
have no land of our own. Nor were our fathers
better off in this respect than ourselves; for, though
freeborn citizens, they were poor, and by their condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>constrained to tend the herds of another,
a man of great property, owning vast droves of
cattle, numerous horses and sheep, several beautiful
estates, with many other possessions, and all
these mountains as far as you can see. This opulence,
however, became his ruin. For the emperor,
casting a covetous eye upon his domains, put him
to death, that he might have a pretext for seizing
on them. Our few beasts went along with our
master’s, and the wages due to us there was no
one to pay.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here, therefore, of necessity we remained<a id='r1833' /><a href='#f1833' class='c012'><sup>[1833]</sup></a> where
two or three huts were left us, with a slight wooden
shed in which the calves had been housed in the summer
nights.<a id='r1834' /><a href='#f1834' class='c012'><sup>[1834]</sup></a> For, during winter, we had been used to
descend for pasture to the plains where, in the proper
season, stores of hay were also laid up; but
with the re-appearance of summer we returned again
to the mountains. The spot which had formed our
principal station now became our fixed dwelling.
Branching off on either hand is a deep and shady
valley, having in the middle a rivulet so shallow as
to be easily traversed, both by cattle and their young.
This stream, flowing from a spring hard by, is pure
and perennial and cooled by the summer wind blowing
perpetually up the ravine. The encircling forests
of oak stretch forth their boughs far above, over a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>carpet of soft verdure, which descends with a gentle
slope into the stream, giving birth to a few gad-flies,<a id='r1835' /><a href='#f1835' class='c012'><sup>[1835]</sup></a>
or any other insect hurtful to herds. Extending
around are numerous lovely meadows, dotted with
lofty trees, where the grass is green and luxuriant
throughout the year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The eloquence of this description, I mean in the
original, is not unworthy to be compared with that
in the Phædrus<a id='r1836' /><a href='#f1836' class='c012'><sup>[1836]</sup></a> which has given eternal bloom to
the platane-tree and agnus castus on the banks of
the Ilissos.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversion of these herdsmen into hunters
is narrated by Dion with a patient simplicity worthy
of Defoe. An air of solitude, snatched from Robinson
Crusoe’s island, seems to breathe at his bidding
over Eubœa. The same education operates strange
changes both in man and dog; and bringing them
into hostile contact with wolves, wild boars, stags,
and other large animals, gives the latter a taste for
blood, and renders him fierce and destructive. Subsisting
by the chase, they pursued it summer and
winter, following both hares and fallow-deer by their
tracks in the snow. In their intervals of leisure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>they strengthened and beautified their dwellings,
saw their children intermarry and grow up to succeed
them, without even once approaching any city
or even village.</p>

<p class='c001'>The style of hospitality prevalent among such men
in antiquity differs very little from that which one
would now find in the hut of a good-natured Albanian.<a id='r1837' /><a href='#f1837' class='c012'><sup>[1837]</sup></a>
Their industry rendered them independent,
and their independence rendered them generous. By
degrees their rustic cottages were surrounded by a
garden and fruit-trees, their court was walled in,
and luxuriant vines hung their foliage and purple
fruit over windows and porch. On the arrival of a
stranger, the wife takes her station at table beside
her husband. Their marriageable daughter, in the
bloom and beauty of youth, aids her brothers in
waiting at table, where host and guest recline on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>highly raised divans of leaves covered with the skins of
beasts. The young maiden, like a rustic Hebe, pours
out the wine, dark and fragrant, while the youths
served up the dishes and then laid out a table for
themselves and dined together. And the sophist,
versed in the courts of satraps and kings, conceived
these rude hunters of the mountains the happiest
and most enviable of mankind.</p>

<p class='c001'>But a pastoral picture is incomplete without love.
The youthful beauty of Caphareus, hidden, like
another Nouronihar<a id='r1838' /><a href='#f1838' class='c012'><sup>[1838]</sup></a> from the world, is accordingly
beloved by her cousin, an adventurous hunter like
her sire, who joins the family circle in the evening,
accompanied by his father, bringing in his hand a hare
as a present to his mistress. The old man salutes
the guest, the youth offers his present with a kiss,
and immediately undertakes the office of the girl,
who thereupon resumes her place beside her mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>Observing this arrangement, the stranger inquires
whether she is not soon to be married to some
wealthy peasant, who might benefit the family,
upon which the youth and maiden blush, and her
father replies,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, but she will take a husband, humble in
rank, and like ourselves a hunter,” glancing at the
same time at the lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How is it then that you wait?” inquired the
stranger. “Do you expect him from the village?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” answered the father, “he is not far off;
and so soon as we can fix upon a fortunate day
the nuptials will be celebrated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And by what do you judge of a fortunate day?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The moon must be approaching the full, the
weather fair, and the atmosphere transparent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And is the youth in reality an able hunter?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am,” said the young man, answering for himself,
“in the chase of the stag or boar, as you
yourself, if you please, shall judge <a id='corr423.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to-morrow”'>to-morrow.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_423.38'><ins class='correction' title='to-morrow”'>to-morrow.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>“And did you take this hare, my friend?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did,” replied he with a smile, “having set a
gin for him by night;<a id='r1839' /><a href='#f1839' class='c012'><sup>[1839]</sup></a> the weather being surpassing
beautiful, and the moon larger than it
ever was before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon this both the old men laughed, and the
lover abashed held his peace.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” observed the father of the maiden, “it
is no fault of mine that the solemnity is deferred;
we only wait at your father’s desire, till a victim
can be purchased; for a sacrifice must be offered
to the gods.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With respect to the victim,” interposed the
maiden’s younger brother, “he has long provided
one, and a noble one too, which is now feeding
behind the cottage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And is it truly so?” demanded the old man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is,” replied the lad.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And where,” addressing the youth, “did you
procure it?” inquired they.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When we took the wild sow,<a id='r1840' /><a href='#f1840' class='c012'><sup>[1840]</sup></a> which was followed
by her litter,” answered he, “and the greater
number, swifter than hares, made their escape; I
hit one with a stone, and my companions coming
up threw a skin over him. This I secured, and
exchanged in the village for a young domestic
pig which has been fatted in a sty behind the
house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I now understand,” exclaimed the father, “the
cause of your mother’s mirth when I would wonder
what that grunting could be, and how the
barley was disappearing so fast.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nevertheless,” observed the young man, “to be
properly fatted our Eubœan swine require acorns.<a id='r1841' /><a href='#f1841' class='c012'><sup>[1841]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>However, if you will just step this way I will
show her to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon which off they went, the boys quite at a
run, and in vast glee.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the meantime, the maiden going into the
other cottage, brought forth a quantity of split service-berries,<a id='r1842' /><a href='#f1842' class='c012'><sup>[1842]</sup></a>
medlars,<a id='r1843' /><a href='#f1843' class='c012'><sup>[1843]</sup></a> and winter apples, and bunches
of superb grapes, bursting ripe,<a id='r1844' /><a href='#f1844' class='c012'><sup>[1844]</sup></a> and, brushing down
the table, she spread them out there upon a layer
of clean fern. Next moment the lads returned
bringing in the pig, with much joking and shouts
of laughter. Then came, too, the young man’s mother,
with two of his little brothers, and they brought
along with them nice white loaves, with boiled eggs
in wooden salvers, with a quantity of parched peas.
Having embraced her brother, with his wife and
daughter, she sat down beside her husband, and
said,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Behold the victim, which my son has long fed
for his marriage, and the other things also are
ready; both the barley-meal and the flour. A
little wine, perhaps, may be wanting, but even
this we can easily procure from the village.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And her son standing near her, fixed his eyes
wistfully upon his father-in-law.</p>

<p class='c001'>The latter smilingly observed,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“All delay now is on the lover’s part, who, perhaps,
is anxious to fatten his pig.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>“As to her,” said the youth, “she is bursting with
fat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon this the sophist, willing to aid the lover,
interposed, and remarked,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you must take care lest while the pig is
fattening he himself grow thin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The stranger’s remark is just,” said his mother;
“for already he is more meagre than he used to be;
and I have of late observed him to be wakeful at
night, and to go forth from the cottage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh! that,” said he, “was when the dogs barked,
and I stepped out to see what was the matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not you!” said his mother,—“but went moping
about. Let us, therefore,” continued she, “put him
to no further trial.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And throwing her arms about her sister, the maiden’s
mother, she kissed her; whereupon the latter,
addressing her husband, said,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us grant them their desire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To which he agreed; and it was resolved, that the
marriage should be solemnized in three days, the
stranger being invited to remain and witness it, which
he did.</p>

<p class='c001'>The above picture of an obscure herdsman’s life
in its naked simplicity, void of all embellishment,
will probably be thought more trustworthy than the
elaborate descriptions of the poets, notwithstanding
that, even in these, it is easy to separate the real
from the fictitious.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the estimation of the Greeks the herdsman<a id='r1845' /><a href='#f1845' class='c012'><sup>[1845]</sup></a>
commonly ranked before the shepherd, and the latter
before the goatherd,—for the dream of rank pursues
mankind even amid the quiet of the fields,—and
their manners are supposed to have corresponded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>Pollux,<a id='r1846' /><a href='#f1846' class='c012'><sup>[1846]</sup></a> however, reckons the goatherd next after
the herdsman, and again inverts the order. Varro,
on the other hand, gives precedence to the shepherd
as the most ancient, the sheep, in his opinion, having
been the animal earliest tamed.</p>

<p class='c001'>In point of utility the goat, in some parts of the
ancient world, rivalled the sheep, producing fine hair
which was shorn like wool.<a id='r1847' /><a href='#f1847' class='c012'><sup>[1847]</sup></a> I may remark, too, in
passing, that the large-tailed sheep still common in
Asia Minor, as well as at the Cape, were anciently
plentiful in Syria, where, according to the great
naturalist,<a id='r1848' /><a href='#f1848' class='c012'><sup>[1848]</sup></a> their tails attained a cubit in breadth.
In some parts of Arabia another more curious breed
was found, with tails three cubits in length, to carry
which they were supplied by the ingenuity of the
shepherds with wooden carriages.<a id='r1849' /><a href='#f1849' class='c012'><sup>[1849]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In most parts of Greece, as well as in the East,
it was customary to bring home the sheep from pasture
towards evening, and shut them up for the night
in warm and roomy cotes, which were surrounded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>wattled fences,<a id='r1850' /><a href='#f1850' class='c012'><sup>[1850]</sup></a> strong and high, both to prevent
them from leaping over, and to exclude the wild
beasts which, in remoter ages, abounded in the mountains.
They were carefully roofed over, and every
other precaution was taken to render them perfectly
dry, the floor being usually pitched with stones, and
slightly inclined. Their bedding<a id='r1851' /><a href='#f1851' class='c012'><sup>[1851]</sup></a> consisted of calaminth
and asphodel and pennyroyal and polion (a
sort of herb whose leaves appear white in the morning,
of a purple colour at noon, and blue when the
sun sets<a id='r1852' /><a href='#f1852' class='c012'><sup>[1852]</sup></a>) and fleabane and southernwood and origany,<a id='r1853' /><a href='#f1853' class='c012'><sup>[1853]</sup></a>
all which repel vermin. The more completely
to effect the same purpose, they were, likewise, in
the habit of fumigating the cotes from time to time,
by burning in them several locks of some shepherdess’s
hair,<a id='r1854' /><a href='#f1854' class='c012'><sup>[1854]</sup></a> together with gum ammoniac, hartshorn, the
hoofs or hair of goats, bitumen, cassia, fleabane, or
calaminth, for the smell of which serpents were
thought to have a peculiar aversion.<a id='r1855' /><a href='#f1855' class='c012'><sup>[1855]</sup></a> Their ordinary
food, while in the folds, consisted of green clover and
cytisus, fenugreek, oaten and barley straw, and vegetable
stalks,<a id='r1856' /><a href='#f1856' class='c012'><sup>[1856]</sup></a> which were supposed to be improved
if sprinkled on the threshing-floor with brine, figs
blown down by the wind, and dry leaves.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>In the short and sharp days of winter,<a id='r1857' /><a href='#f1857' class='c012'><sup>[1857]</sup></a> they were
not led forth to pasture till both the dew and
the hoar frost had disappeared; but in summer
the shepherds were careful to be a-field with the
dawn while the dew was still heavy on the grass.
In Attica<a id='r1858' /><a href='#f1858' class='c012'><sup>[1858]</sup></a> and the environs of Miletus, where was
produced the finest and costliest wool in the ancient
world, the sheep<a id='r1859' /><a href='#f1859' class='c012'><sup>[1859]</sup></a> were protected from rain
and dust and brambles and whatever else could
damage their fleeces<a id='r1860' /><a href='#f1860' class='c012'><sup>[1860]</sup></a> by housings of purple leather.<a id='r1861' /><a href='#f1861' class='c012'><sup>[1861]</sup></a>
The same practice prevailed also in the Megaris,
where Diogenes beholding a flock of sheep<a id='r1862' /><a href='#f1862' class='c012'><sup>[1862]</sup></a> thus
clad, while the children, like those of the Egyptian
peasants were suffered to run about naked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>said, “It is better to be a Megarean’s ram
than his son.” Ælian<a id='r1863' /><a href='#f1863' class='c012'><sup>[1863]</sup></a> alludes to this saying for
the purpose of noticing the ignorance and want of
education prevalent among the Megareans. We
find likewise in Plutarch<a id='r1864' /><a href='#f1864' class='c012'><sup>[1864]</sup></a> another version of the
anecdote taxing these Dorians with avarice and
meanness. Augustus imitated the saying of Diogenes
and applied it to Herod, hearing of whose
cruelty to his family, he said, “It were better to be
Herod’s hog than his son.”<a id='r1865' /><a href='#f1865' class='c012'><sup>[1865]</sup></a> But if the Megareans
lived poorly they built grandly: so that of them it
was said, that they ate as if they were to die to-morrow,
and built as if they were to live for ever.<a id='r1866' /><a href='#f1866' class='c012'><sup>[1866]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Sheep, as most persons familiar with the country
will probably have observed, are wont in hot summer
days to retire during the prevalence of the sun’s
greatest heat beneath the shade of spreading trees,<a id='r1867' /><a href='#f1867' class='c012'><sup>[1867]</sup></a>
at which time a green sweep of uplands dotted
with antique oaks or beeches,<a id='r1868' /><a href='#f1868' class='c012'><sup>[1868]</sup></a> each with its stem
encircled by some portion of the flock reposing upon
their own fleeces, presents a picture of singular beauty
and tranquillity. The picturesque features of the
scene were in old times enhanced by the addition
of several accompaniments now nowhere to be found,
consisting of statues, altars, or chapels, erected in
honour of the rural gods or nymphs.<a id='r1869' /><a href='#f1869' class='c012'><sup>[1869]</sup></a> Fountains,
moreover, of limpid water<a id='r1870' /><a href='#f1870' class='c012'><sup>[1870]</sup></a> in many places gushed
forth from beneath the trees, where there were usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>a number of seats for the accommodation of
the shepherds and shepherdesses. In these retreats
they generally passed the sultry hours of the
day, playing on the pastoral flute or the syrinx,
chanting their wild lays, or amusing each other
by the relation of those strange legends which inhabited
the woods and lonely mountains of Greece.<a id='r1871' /><a href='#f1871' class='c012'><sup>[1871]</sup></a>
There prevailed among them a superstition against
disturbing by their music or otherwise that hushed
stillness which most persons must have observed
to characterise the summer noon. At this hour of
the day the God Pan,<a id='r1872' /><a href='#f1872' class='c012'><sup>[1872]</sup></a> in the opinion of Greek
shepherds, took his rest after the toils of the chase,
reclining under a tree in the solitary forest;<a id='r1873' /><a href='#f1873' class='c012'><sup>[1873]</sup></a> and,
as he was held to be of a hasty choleric disposition,
they abstained at that time from piping through
fear of provoking his anger. The other Gods likewise
were believed to enjoy a short sleep at this
time, as we find in the case of the nymph Aura, in
the Dionysiacs.<a id='r1874' /><a href='#f1874' class='c012'><sup>[1874]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From a passage in St. John’s gospel it would
appear, that the practice prevailed among the Oriental
shepherds of distinguishing the several members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>of their flocks by separate names: “The sheep
hear his voice, and he calleth his own sheep by
name and leadeth them out. And when he putteth
forth his own sheep he goeth before them,
and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.”
We likewise find traces of the same custom in
Sicily, Crete, and various other parts of Greece,
where goats, and heifers, and sheep, enjoyed the
privilege of a name, as Cynœtha, Amalthea, and
others. In later times it was judged preferable,
that the flock should follow their shepherds by the
eye, for which reason they were accustomed to stuff
their ears with wool.<a id='r1875' /><a href='#f1875' class='c012'><sup>[1875]</sup></a> To prevent rams from butting,
they used to bore a hole<a id='r1876' /><a href='#f1876' class='c012'><sup>[1876]</sup></a> through their horns
near the roots. Sheep were generally shorn<a id='r1877' /><a href='#f1877' class='c012'><sup>[1877]</sup></a> during
the month of May, and after the wool had been
clipped, they were commonly anointed with wine,
oil, and the juice of bitter lupins.<a id='r1878' /><a href='#f1878' class='c012'><sup>[1878]</sup></a> In remoter ages
the practice prevailed of plucking off the wool instead
of shearing it; and this barbarous method, at
once so painful to the sheep and so laborious to
the shepherd, had not been entirely abandoned in
the age of Pliny.<a id='r1879' /><a href='#f1879' class='c012'><sup>[1879]</sup></a> It was a rule among the
pastoral tribes, that the number of their flocks
should be uneven.<a id='r1880' /><a href='#f1880' class='c012'><sup>[1880]</sup></a> The shepherds of Greece bestowed
the name of Sekitai,<a id='r1881' /><a href='#f1881' class='c012'><sup>[1881]</sup></a> (from σηκος an enclosure)
upon lambs taken early from the ewes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>fed by hand. They were usually kept in a cote
apart from the other sheep.</p>

<p class='c001'>As flocks, in most parts of Greece, were exposed
to the rapacity of the wolf,<a id='r1882' /><a href='#f1882' class='c012'><sup>[1882]</sup></a> the shepherds had recourse
to an extraordinary contrivance, to destroy
this fierce animal; kindling large charcoal fires in
open spaces in the woods, they cast thereon the
powder of certain diminutive fish, caught in great
numbers along the grassy shores of Greece, together
with small slices of lamb and kid. Attracted by
the savour which they could snuff from a distance,
the wolves flocked in great numbers towards the
fires, round which they prowled with loud howlings,
in expectation of sharing the prey, the odour of
which had drawn them thither. Stupified at length

and freedom from care supposed
to be tasted in the seclusion of
the country, appears in all ages
to have led to the belief, that
there is something more natural
in fields and forests than in cities,
though it be quite as necessary
that man should have dwellings
as that he should cultivate the
ground. The paradox, however,
is thus expressed by Varro: Divina

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1778'>1778</a>. Travellers find among the
modern shepherds of the East
much the same tastes and habits.
“The hills,” observed Dr. Chandler,
speaking of Lydia, “were
enlivened by flocks of sheep and
goats, and resounded with the
rude music of the lyre and of
the pipe; the former a stringed
instrument resembling a guitar,
and held much in the same
manner, but usually played on
with a bow.” Chandler, i. p.
85. Cf. Theocrit. Eidyll. i. 7.
viii. 9.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1779'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1779'>1779</a>. The same habits still prevail:
“We could discern fires on Lesbos
as before on several islands and
capes, made chiefly by fishermen
and shepherds, who live much
abroad in the air, to burn the
strong stalks of the Turkey wheat
and the dry herbage on the mountains.”

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1780'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1780'>1780</a>. Among other things we find
them putting the strongest faith
in dreams—at least we may suppose
the fishermen in Theocritus,
who lay so much stress on the
visions of the night, to hold a
creed pretty nearly akin to that
of shepherds. Eidyll. 21. v. 29.

<div class='footnote' id='f1781'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1781'>1781</a>. The gods they principally
worshiped were Pan, the Muses,
and the Nymphs. To the
Nymphs and Pan they sacrificed
as to gods presiding over mountains,
where they themselves
usually wandered. Pan, moreover,
was skilled in the pipe, the
instrument of their race. The
Muses they adored as the goddesses
of poetry and music. Schol.
Theoc. i. 6. In verse 12 of the
same Eidyll. the Nymphs are
spoken of where the office of the
Muses is in contemplation, which
may easily be explained. For
the Muses are properly the
Nymphs of those fountains which
inspire poets with their lays. Cf.
Voss. ad Virg. Eclog. iii. 84.

respects to the agricultural:—“The
two simplest and most
primitive trades of life; that
of the shepherd (who by reason
of his leisure, rests in a place,
and living in view of heaven,
is a lively image of a contemplative
life) and that of the
husbandman; where we see the
favour of God went to the
shepherd and not to the tiller
of the ground.”—Advancement

<div class='footnote' id='f1809'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1809'>1809</a>. Even yet we find the shepherds
of Greece retain some
smack of classical learning:
“After dinner I walked out
with a shepherd’s boy to herbarise;
my pastoral botanist
surprised me not a little with
his nomenclature; I traced the
names of Dioscorides, and Theophrastus,
corrupted, indeed, in
some degree by pronunciation,
and by the long <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>series annorum</i></span>,
which had elapsed since the
time of these philosophers, but
many of them were unmutilated,
and their virtues faithfully
handed down in the oral traditions
of the country. My shepherd
boy returned to his fold
not less satisfied with some
paras that I had given him,
than I was in finding in such
a rustic a repository of ancient
science.”—Sibth. in Walp. i.
66, seq. There is in Sir John
Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum
Angliæ, translated by Robert
Mulcaster, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, a passage describing
the pastoral habits of our ancestors,
and the intellectual superiority
they engendered, which
appears to me so excellent, that
I cannot resist the temptation
to introduce it here:—“England
is so fertile and fruitefull, that
comparing quantity to quantity
it surmounteth all other landes
in fruitefulnesse. Yea, it bringeth
forth fruite of itselfe, scant
provoked by mann’s industrie
and labour. For there the
landes, the fieldes, the groves,
and the woodes, doe so aboundantlye
springe, that the same
untilled doe commonly yield to
their owners more profite then
tilled, though else they bee
most fruitefull of corne and
graine. There also are fieldes
of pasture inclosed with hedges
and ditches, with trees planted
and growing uppon the same,
which are a defence to their
heardes of sheepe and cattell,
against stormes and heate of
the sunne; and the pastures are
commonly watered, so that cattell
shutte and closed therein
have no neede of keeping neither
by day, nor by night.
For there bee no wolves, nor
beares, nor lyons, wherefore
their sheepe lye by night in
the fields, unkept within their
foldes wherewith their land is
manured. By the meanes
whereof, the men of that countrie
are scant troubled with
any painefull labour, wherefore
they live more spiritually, as
did the ancient fathers, which
did rather choose to keepe and
feede cattell, than to disturbe
the quietnesse of the minde with
care of husbandrie. And heereof
it cometh, that menne of
this countrie are more apte and
fitte to discerne in doubtfull
causes of great examination
and triall, than are menne
whollye given to moyling in
the ground; in whom that
rurall exercise engendereth
rudeness of witte and minde.”

who had diligently studied
the pastoral nations of Asia in
their general habits and characteristics,
that ambition and the
spirit of conquest are powerfully
excited by the shepherd’s manner
of life. “The thrones of Asia
have been repeatedly overturned
by the shepherds of the north,
and their arms have spread terror
and devastation over the
most fertile and warlike countries
of Europe. On this occasion,
as well as on many others,
the sober historian is forcibly
awakened from a pleasing vision
and is compelled with some reluctance
to confess, that the
pastoral manners which have
been adorned with the fairest
attributes of peace and innocence
are much better adapted
to the fierce and cruel habits of
a military life.” Decline and

perhaps cherished not a

they bear to their Eolian rocks

Turkish shepherd in Asia Minor.
Dr. Chandler has a passage illustrative
of the hospitality of pastoral
tribes, which is at once so
picturesque and concise that I am
tempted to transcribe it: “About
two in the morning our whole
attention was fixed by the
barking of dogs, which, as we
advanced, became exceedingly
furious. Deceived by the light
of the moon we now fancied we
could see a village, and were
much mortified to find only a
station of poor goatherds without
even a shed, and nothing
for our horses to eat. They
were lying wrapped in their
thick capotes or loose-coats by
some glimmering embers, among
the bushes in a dale under a
spreading tree by the fold.
They received us hospitably,
heaping on fresh fuel and producing
caimac or sour curds
and coarse bread which they
toasted for us on the coals.
We made a scanty meal, sitting
on the ground lighted by the
fire and by the moon, after
which sleep suddenly overpowered
me. On waking I found
my companions by my side,
sharing in the comfortable cover
of the Janizary’s cloak which
he had carefully spread over us.
I was now much struck with
the wild appearance of the spot.
The tree was hung with rustic
utensils, the she-goats in a pen
sneezed and bleated and rustled
to and fro; the shrubs, by which
our horses stood, were leafless,
and the earth bare; a black
cauldron with milk was simmering
over the fire, and a
figure more than gaunt or savage
close by us was struggling
on the ground with a kid whose
ears he had slit, and was endeavouring
to cauterise with a
piece of red-hot iron.” Chandler,
vol. i. 180, seq.</p>

3. Speaking of the neighbourhood
of Smyrna,—The “sheep,”
observed Dr. Chandler, “have
broad tails, hanging down like
an apron, some weighing eight,
ten, or more pounds. These
are eaten as a dainty, and the
fat, before they are full-grown,
accounted as delicious as marrow.”
Travels, i. 77. Of the
broad-tailed sheep mentioned by
the ancients the most remarkable
were those of India, where,
according to Ctesios, of veracious
memory, both they and the goats
were larger than asses:—τὰ πρόβατα

of Bruce respecting the carving of
a rump-steak from a live cow,—for
the Indians, observes Ælian,
were in the habit of cutting
open the tails of the rams, extracting
all the fat, and then sowing
them up again so dexterously
that in a short time no trace of
the incision remained visible.</p>

Cytisus, it is observed by Æschylides,
in Ælian. de Nat. Animal.
xvi. 32, that the rustics of
Cios, on account of the aridity
of the island, possessed few flocks.
Those they had, however, were
fed entirely on the leaves of the
cytisus, the fig-tree, and the olive,
mingled occasionally with the
straw and halm of vegetables.
The lambs reared on this island
were of singular beauty, and sold
at a higher price than those of
most other parts. In Lydia and
Macedonia sheep were sometimes
fattened upon fish, which must
have given the mutton of those
countries a somewhat unsavoury
odour. Ælian. De Nat. Animal.

of sheep was the leaves of the
white nymphæa, the tender shoots
of which were eaten by swine,
while men themselves fed upon
the fruit. Theoph. Hist. Plant.

Miletos in softness, but was of a
glossy jet colour like that of the
raven’s wing. Φέρει δ᾽ ὁ περὶ

The flowering ash hung

saxifrages, and the snowy Isopyrum,
with the Campanula Pyramidalis;
this latter plant is now
called χαρισονη; it yields abundance
of a sweet milky fluid, and
was said to promote a secretion
of milk, a quality first attributed
to it under the doctrine of signatures.
Our guide made nose-gays
of the fragrant leaves of the
Fraxinella; the common nettle
was not forgotten as a pot-herb,

it would appear that the
method observed by the ancient

the wolf is no longer known to
their descendants, though the apprehension
of their destructiveness
and ferocity be as great as ever.

wolf, which appears to have varied
in different ages; (cf. Plut.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
